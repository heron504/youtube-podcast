Jason sits down with Wilson Sonsini partner Chris Paniewski for a special Startup Legal Basics on one of the thorniest questions in tech right now: how copyright law applies to AI training data.

Chris has worked on some of the biggest AI deals ever ‚Äî including Scale AI‚Äôs $14B+ partnership with Meta and OpenAI‚Äôs $6.5B acquisition of Jony Ive‚Äôs design studio ‚Äî and brings practical, on-the-ground insights from advising leading AI companies.

‚Ä¢ The difference between *training data* and *output* in legal terms
‚Ä¢ How ‚Äúfair use‚Äù really works (and why it‚Äôs a defense, not a permission slip)
‚Ä¢ The risks of scraping vs. licensing, and why open source ‚â† free use
‚Ä¢ How investors are diligencing AI startups around training data
‚Ä¢ Why startups must think differently once they‚Äôre funded vs. hacking in a dorm room
