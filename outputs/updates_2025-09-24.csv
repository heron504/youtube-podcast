2025-09-23T09:00:01Z,Sequoia Capital,UCWrF0oN6unbXrWsTN7RctTw,Why Businesses Are Rejecting the AI They‚Äôve Asked For ft Agency CEO Elias Torres,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cczp_HQPAQ,0cczp_HQPAQ,"Elias Torres has been building AI systems since 1999, from chatbots at IBM to co-founding Drift and now Agency. He believes businesses are caught in an expectation mismatch‚Äîdemanding AI while rejecting it due to imperfection anxiety. Drawing from his experience scaling HubSpot, Elias explains why human-led customer experience doesn‚Äôt scale and how Agency is building AI-first solutions that work autonomously. His contrarian approach focuses on the back-end customer experience rather than front-end AI SDRs, aiming to ‚Äúdeprogram the entire business world‚Äù from inefficient human-dependent processes.
