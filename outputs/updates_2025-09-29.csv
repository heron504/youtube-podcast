From the Masters of Scale Summit stage in 2024, Vinod Khosla, legendary venture capitalist and co-founder of Sun Microsystems, argues that radical innovation almost never comes from big institutions. From Amazon reinventing retail to Tesla transforming the auto industry, he highlights how start-ups and entrepreneurs, not governments or corporate giants, drive the breakthroughs that reshape entire industries. In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, Vinod makes the case that it‚Äôs the outsiders and instigators who chart the path forward ‚Äî while larger players follow once the model has been proven.
