After leaving his role as Global AI Lead at Amazon's private equity business development team, where he worked with hundreds of PE-backed companies on AI initiatives, Brendan launched Zeus with a bold vision: become the Palantir for AI transformations. The model seemed perfect on paper - target Fortune 500 companies with $5-10 million contracts, build custom AI agents for any use case, and leverage a proprietary platform to maintain high margins. But six months in, the reality hit hard. From insurance RFPs with Excel spreadsheets embedded in Word documents to the crushing weight of ongoing maintenance costs, Brendan shares the unvarnished truth about why the economics didn't work.
