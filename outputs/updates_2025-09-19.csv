After leaving his role as Global AI Lead at Amazon's private equity business development team, where he worked with hundreds of PE-backed companies on AI initiatives, Brendan launched Zeus with a bold vision: become the Palantir for AI transformations. The model seemed perfect on paper - target Fortune 500 companies with $5-10 million contracts, build custom AI agents for any use case, and leverage a proprietary platform to maintain high margins. But six months in, the reality hit hard. From insurance RFPs with Excel spreadsheets embedded in Word documents to the crushing weight of ongoing maintenance costs, Brendan shares the unvarnished truth about why the economics didn't work.

Jason sits down with Wilson Sonsini partner Chris Paniewski for part two of our Startup Legal Basics series on AI law â€” this time tackling the question every founder is asking: who owns the output of AI systems?

Chris has advised on some of the biggest AI deals in history, and in this episode he helps break down how intellectual property law is colliding with generative AI.

Jason and Chris cover:
â€¢ What kinds of IP rights might apply to AI-generated output (*copyrights, patents, trade secrets*)
â€¢ Why human authorship is central to copyright law
â€¢ Whether prompts are protectable IP
â€¢ How GenAI platformsâ€™ terms of service affect ownership
â€¢ Real-world examples from Star Wars to Wirecutter to Warhol
â€¢ What startups should document when using AI in development
â€¢ How investors diligence AI companies on IP strategy

If youâ€™re a founder, investor, or operator trying to understand how to responsibly use AI without losing your IP, this conversation is essential.

Amos shares the playbook for the ""Autonomous Business,"" a model aiming for an unprecedented $10 million in ARR per employee. He details how Swann is on a mission to hit $30 million in ARR with just its three founders and a sophisticated ecosystem of AI agents. 

Amos provides a masterclass in applied AI, breaking down how Swann built an entire go-to-market engine that generated over $1 million in ARR in just nine weeks without a single SDR. We explore their internal agents like ""Shakespeare"" for content, ""The Observer"" for lead intelligence, and ""The Connector"" for automated outreach.

He's also one of the very few people who started as a programmer -- just trying to solve his own problem -- and still runs his company as CEO today even as it approaches a $200B market cap. Tobi has done this in two big ways: first, a willingness throw away his past beliefs in the face of new data, growing into the leader the company needed. And second, by remaining a close observer (and participant!) in how new technology emerges that changes what is possible.

Today on ACQ2, we talk with him about both. The first half of the episode is about what has changed for him in the AI era. How he spends his time with AI throughout the day, how he thinks about what AI unlocks philosophically, and what he thinks the impact will be on all of us and what we build. The second half is more about Shopify. How he dealt mentally with the explosion in stock price in 2021 from a 20x revenue multiple to a 70x revenue multiple. And then â€¦",1137,37,3,PT1H48M41S
