Can America Catch Up?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShkxpBoObCQ,ShkxpBoObCQ,"Ben, Marc, and Erik Torenberg are joined by Brian Schimpf, Cofounder & CEO of Anduril, and Chris Power, Founder & CEO of Hadrian. Together, they dig into America‚Äôs defense production gap: why the U.S. can out-innovate but not out-produce, and what it will take to turn that around.

They discuss why U.S. war games show we run out of munitions in a week, the myth of ‚Äúexquisite-only‚Äù systems, how to rebuild industrial capacity with software-led automation, financing factories like data centers, and what it takes to create real deterrence in a Taiwan scenario.
