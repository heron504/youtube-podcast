2025-09-12T15:32:21Z,Dwarkesh Patel,UCXl4i9dYBrFOabk0xGmbkRA,Fully autonomous robots are much closer than you think – Sergey Levine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48pxVdmkMIE,48pxVdmkMIE,"Sergey Levine is one of the world’s top robotics researchers and co-founder of Physical Intelligence. He thinks we’re on the cusp of a “self-improvement flywheel” for general-purpose robots. His median estimate for when robots will be able to run households entirely autonomously? 2030.

If Sergey’s right, the world 5 years from now will be an *insanely* different place than it is today. This conversation focuses on understanding how we get there: we dive into foundation models for robotics, and how we scale both the data and the hardware necessary to enable a full-blown robotics explosion.
