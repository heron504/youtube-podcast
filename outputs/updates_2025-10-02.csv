He breaks down how Cerebras achieved 20x faster performance than NVIDIA's B200 GPUs through their revolutionary wafer-scale architecture, featuring a chip the size of a dinner plate with 2,625x more memory bandwidth than traditional GPUs.

Andrew shares the journey from meeting Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever at OpenAI in 2016 when they were ""just PowerPoint and an idea,"" to now serving major customers like Cognition, Mistral, Meta, and IBM. He explains the fundamental architectural decisions that enabled Cerebras to excel at both training and inference, including their choice to use SRAM over HBM memory and their focus on sparse linear algebra rather than specialized convolutions.
