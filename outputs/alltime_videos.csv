Software startup Shortcut (previously named Clubhouse) built its product specifically for distributed teams, and the company had a high percentage of employees working remotely even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. But Shortcut CEO and co-founder Kurt Schrader said the shift to 100% remote work has provided fresh insight into the need for more and better tools that effectively recreate the ambient intelligence of working in an office. Kurt sat down with Greylock general partner Sarah Guo to discuss how the company is internally adapting to remote-first, how usage patterns are changing among their customers, and how Shortcut is thinking about the next phase of product development.

Yet most organizations are still contending with inadequate tools that enable them to safely share, collaborate, and build with data. What’s more, many businesses lack the engineering resources to develop workarounds in the form of anonymized data sets or synthetic datasets that can be used to run powerful tests. Ali Golshan, the CEO and co-founder of Gretel.ai, says that dynamic has put the majority of businesses and organizations at a disadvantage when it comes to innovation, which is exactly where Gretel.ai comes in. The company, which was founded in 2019, aims to be the “GitHub of data,” stepping into to provide tools for data similar to the way the open platform effectively democratized building with code.

2022-05-05T19:00:06Z,Greylock,UCZ7x7yDBbEFCGztD8BYvRhA,Quora | Becoming a Remote-First Company,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZxL9bbBsIs,QZxL9bbBsIs,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, tech startup Quora had a strong office culture and discouraged employees from working remotely most of the time. But once the company had no choice, Quora CEO and co-founder Adam D'Angelo says they discovered the benefits of working from anywhere far outweigh the drawbacks. In late June, Quora announced it would become a remote first company. Adam discusses the decision with Greylock partner David Thacker. This episode is part of Greymatter's #WorkFromAnywhere series hosted by David and fellow Greylock partners Sarah Guo.

Most founders learn the hard way.  Frederic Kerrest’s experience was no different. The early days of Okta, which he co-founded with Todd McKinnon in 2009, were rife with challenges. From flawed go-to-market strategies and missed sales targets to struggles with hiring, Kerrest and McKinnon dealt with it all. On top of it all, it was in the midst of the Great Recession. 
That experience is why Kerrest wrote Zero to IPO, a collection of some of the best actionable advice from some of the world’s most influential entrepreneurs. The book, which was published earlier this year, details his early days at Okta as well as those of other iconic entrepreneurs. 

As part of our Iconversations speaker series, Kerrest joined Greylock general partner Sarah Guo to discuss the key themes of the book and share detailed examples of how they played out at Okta.

As part of Greylock's interactive data project Castles in the Cloud, we've analyzed new areas of opportunities for startups. Platforms within the modern data stack pose multiple points of entry for startups to innovate. VCs are already looking for “the next Snowflake” – companies that find success in the shadow of Big Cloud by reimagining the modern data stack. To solidify their staying power, the next chapter for Snowflake and other cloud data warehouses is to continue to expand as a platform company and challenge the cloud providers as the dominant cloud platforms for developers.

Entrepreneurship assumes an innate degree of optimism and perseverance. But even the most determined founders can feel subdued when faced with yet another crisis. That’s why adaptability is a startup’s strongest asset. As recent global events push us into a new era of market volatility and economic uncertainty, companies must be prepared to recalibrate their business to the new reality. Whether that means pausing their hiring plans, tempering their expansion efforts, redirecting resources, or any other number of operational activities, today’s startup leaders should have a set of defensive and offensive tactics they can quickly deploy during times of crisis.

Reid Hoffman offers advice for the Class of startups in 2020. While there is a tendency for pundits to say that everything has changed, and that we’re in a new world, Reid posits that more is actually the same than different. Converting challenge into opportunity is a normal part of the entrepreneurial journey, and right now is precisely when people with entrepreneurial skills are accomplishing amazing things, because generally speaking, it's actually better in the long-run to successfully start a business during a recession than during a bull market.

But getting it right requires careful consideration, as Reid and Chris discuss in detail.

2022-07-14T17:00:19Z,Greylock,UCZ7x7yDBbEFCGztD8BYvRhA,Reid Hoffman | Myths About Failure,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4tx6AsGbys,P4tx6AsGbys,"Greylock general partner and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and his Blitzscaling co-author Chris Yeh discuss one the most common outcomes of startups: Failure. But although failure is often the default state for startups, it is neither inevitable nor is it necessarily the end of the story. Even if you are able to bring yourself to look failure in the eye, you can take steps to maximize your chance of success. And even if you fail despite your best efforts, if you behave ethically and demonstrate that you've learned from the mistakes you might have made along the way, failure is definitely not the end. In fact, it may be the beginning.

In late 2021, Solv was wrapping up its Series C round when Fernandez was encouraged by longtime investor and friend Kara Norton (Upfront Ventures) to launch a special purpose vehicle (SPV) aimed solely at women investors. Within 10 days, the SPV raised $3.5M from 75 women investors, 60% of whom were women of color and a majority were first-time investors. Fernandez and Schreiber discuss the process and provide a playbook for other entrepreneurs.

People of color have largely been left out of this group. Changing that reality is the mission of career advancement nonprofit Management Leadership of Tomorrow (MLT), which works to put people of color in leadership positions. A major part of MLT’s work is dispelling the myth that the lack of diversity in the tech industry comes from a so-called pipeline problem of talented African American, Latinx and Native American science, engineering and computer science grads.

Through that discovery process, researchers are identifying ways to design artificial intelligence in ways that factor in the safety and morality of their potential impact. 

Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman interviews Dr. Fei-Fei Li, the co-director of Stanford's Institute for Human-Centered AI, and Mira Murati, the CTO of OpenAI. In this interview, they discuss how technology like GPT-3 is being trained with human safety in mind, and how academia, industry, and policymakers are coming together to ensure AI is developed and deployed in ways that benefit all. 

This interview took place during Greylock's Intelligent Future event, a daylong summit featuring experts and entrepreneurs working in artificial intelligence.

The company struck a chord both with retail entrepreneurs in need of better solutions and app developers eager to build them. Today, Shopify works with more than a million businesses that collectively represent some 10% of e-commerce in the United States, providing tools for companies to set up, sell, market, and manage their products. 

Shopify president Harley Finkelstein sat down with Greylock general partner Mike Duboe to discuss the company's evolution along with the overall ecommerce landscape; offer advice to entrepreneurs navigating the current market conditions; and lay out his vision for the future.

They happen to pretty much everyone, but whether a company is prepared to recover from it depends on multiple factors, from their level of understanding of the risk to the data protection tools they have at their disposal. Most aren't:  A recent survey conducted by Zero Labs found 92% of security and IT leaders don't feel confident they could carry on business if they experience a cyber attack. What's more, about a third of organizations surveyed said a cyber attack led to a leadership change, and many reported a misalignment between IT and security teams. Bipul, Steve, and Jon discuss the more findings from the report and outline how companies can protect their organizations.

Crypto hype and speculation got us into the current chaotic winter. But the core infrastructure remains, and is still ripe for the innovation that will take us into the next crypto summer. There are many real use cases across financial services that can not only usher us into a more secure, inclusive, and efficient financial system, but also return trust and ownership to those for whom crypto was created in the first place – the users. Rosenberg unpacks the use case of defi lending to illustrate how this can be done.

As more enterprise organizations have recognized the utility of artificial intelligence technology, there's been a major push to invest in and adopt new AI and ML infrastructure to drive insights and make predictions for businesses. However, many of these solutions lack the mechanism to unlock and operationalize the data needed to train and deploy models for high quality AI projects. That pain point spawned the creation of Snorkel AI, which has developed an end-to-end data-centric machine learning platform for the enterprise.The company spun out of Stanford's AI Lab in 2019 and has been partnered with Greylock since 2020, and just released a new set of tools that enables enterprise organizations to put foundation models to use.

Zoox's unique approach to autonomous driving (building all of the hardware and software in-house, from the ground up), means the entire company is oriented around the same mission and priorities. From the people building the door handles to the developers coding the software, keeping riders safe is the paramount focus for every Zoox employee. That means all teams must operate with total transparency and expect a culture of collective learning, patience, and tradeoffs, says Evans. 

“Zoox has a very transparent culture – some would argue too transparent. But there’s one plan. Everybody knows it. If you work here, I’m not giving you any opportunity for it to be secret,” says Evans.

While past generations of startups could get away with focusing purely on the technical aspects of their product in the initial stages and bring design teams later, today's startups are living in the age following an explosion of consumer apps (and the subsequent push for consumerization of enterprise software) that has resulted in a heavy focus on the end user experience. Good design is now a critical part of a company's success.

In just a few months, the population of job-seekers will further expand as a wave of fresh graduates – many of whom will be taking on the first serious role of their career – enter the market. The dearth of open roles can be discouraging to any candidate, and those at the beginning of their careers may feel this even more acutely. A bright spot is early-stage startups in need of talent to build core teams, and for many, the best match may be the newest job seeker. 

Yuliya Mykhaylovska, who leads university recruiting for Greylock's talent team, shares how to evaluate and recruit candidates at the earliest stages of their career, and outlines how startup founders can best structure the role to allow flexibility and growth along with the company.

This week,  Reid Hoffman poses questions to OpenAI's ChatGPT about the potential impact of AI in educational settings. 

Of the many transformative possibilities of artificial intelligence, its potential to impact education is among the most exciting. It’s also one of the most contentious. While it could extend the reach of over-worked teachers, offer personalized curriculums, and enhance the learning experience, it could also present many drawbacks: cheating, loss of jobs, and a reliance on technology that impedes the development of critical-thinking skills.

Cloud native is the new order of business. But most existing monitoring technology is insufficient to contend with the complex, dynamic, and ephemeral nature of the modern cloud environment. That's why Martin Mao and Rob Skillington formed Chronosphere, a purpose-built platform to monitor cloud-native infrastructure and apps and enable organizations to make precise, data-driven decisions. In this episode of Greymatter, Martin and Rob sit down with Greylock general partner and Chronosphere board member Jerry Chen to discuss the company’s growth, the current state of cloud technology, and the challenges and advantages of starting a company just before the global crisis of 2020.

When finance teams have a greater influence on everyday operations, companies can more nimbly respond to economic events – both good and bad. That's why TraceHQ developed a platform that functions as a service desk for finance; providing visibility for teams to immediately see how their financial decisions impact their budget. It then gives finance the committed forecast – a real-time financial plan. TraceHQ CEO and co-founder Mike Gonzalez discussed how TraceHQ was developed, why financial leaders should be more deeply ingrained into day-to-day operations, and what companies should do to be prepared for whatever the future presents.

The book aims to serve as a sort of “travelog” of Hoffman’s experience with GPT-4, as he explores the tool’s strengths and limitations. Through hundreds of prompts, Hoffman and GPT-4 discuss the potential advantages and drawbacks of AI, argue about human nature, conceive original sci fi plots, and even try to make a few jokes. As AI is quickly advancing, Hoffman hopes his book can serve as a guide to encourage people to learn more about the technology, consider how we might use it, and ponder the complex questions about how our choices might play out in the future.

Hoffman and Tubbs – who was recently named by CA Governor Gavin Newsom to serve as the state's Special Advisor for Economy Mobility and Opportunity – discuss how a pervasive lack of diversity among tech founders, investors, and operators has translated to a disconnect between the industry and the rest of the world.

When Rubrik launched in 2014, its mission to secure the world's data resonated immediately with clients, and the company grew rapidly in the first few years.Then came a rough patch, as the company's relentless push for expansion – and the many more people involved in every decision, from hiring to product pipeline  – impacted the leadership team's focus. Recognizing this, Sinha recalibrated his approach, and Rubrik got back on track. In this discussion, he shares his strategy for collaborative decision-making without losing sight of one's own ideas.

Here's what we covered:
 
4:30 – AI is really taking off – Why now? 
 
8:21 – How do you think about identifying durable companies? 
 
18:28 – What are some verticals you are particularly excited about? 
 
19:16 – With the advent of new foundation models like GPT-4, we can automate data training and make it faster. Do we still need traditional MLOps tools focused on data training, or will we fully migrate onto LLM-powered data training and automation tools?

Ramp, a fintech startup that is noted for being one of the fastest-growing companies ever to hit $100M in ARR, is among the fintech frontrunners using automation and machine learning to help customers with expense management, payments, reporting, and more. The upside of automated, intelligent, personalized, and more secure financial services with the help of AI is in reach.

Alex Graveley was the principal engineer and Chief Architect behind Github Copilot, a sort of pair-programmer that auto-completes your code as you type. It has rapidly become a product that developers won’t live without, and the most leaned-upon analogy for every new AI startup – Copilot for Finance, Sales, Marketing, Support, Writing, Decision-Making.

Alex is a longtime hacker and tinkerer, open source contributor, repeat founder, and creator of products that millions of people use, such as Dropbox Paper. He has a new project in stealth, Minion AI. In this episode, we talk about the uncertain process of shipping Copilot, how code improves chain of thought for LLMs, how they improved product, performance, how people are using it, AI agents that can do work for us, stress testing society's resilience to waves of new technology, and his new startup named Minion.

That accident finally came in 2011 when a host’s apartment was ransacked. It set off a period of soul searching that became a turning point—the company’s efforts to rebuild trust led it to becoming the global behemoth it is today. In this episode, Brian reveals how this crisis shaped his thinking, and how the lessons would apply to the company’s next defining moments, including a pandemic that shut down global travel.

The founders of all these companies got their start when the internet was just taking off, at a fledgling payments startup. PayPal would become a defining tech company, with many of its breakthroughs becoming standard practices for a generation of startups. But these lessons were hard-won in the company’s chaotic start. The PayPal of today only exists because of how its team navigated early crucible moments, including a merger between enemies, a battle against fraud that resulted in security innovations still in use today, and a decision to pursue one of the most significant tech IPOs following the dot-com crash. Explore the inflection points that shaped a cornerstone of Silicon Valley.

Jack Dorsey - A controversial hack week project becomes the #1 financial services app,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef6GXMNMsNI,Ef6GXMNMsNI,"CEO Jack Dorsey’s ultimate vision for Block was always about economic empowerment for all. Initially called Square, the company’s first product—the white dongle that let small businesses turn an iPhone into a credit card reader—was just a first step. So when a hack week project called Cash App that let anyone send money for free started gaining traction, Dorsey wanted to support it. It was easier said than done. It seemed like a strategic departure and it was costing lots of time and money. “Everyone wanted to kill it,” Dorsey says. Today, Cash App accounts for half the company’s revenue.  In this episode, Dorsey explains how the company navigated this strategic shift, and how companies can succeed by weaving successive products and experiences around a singular, core vision.

Today on No Priors, Elad and Sarah are joined by Pinecone CEO, Edo Liberty, to talk about how RAG architecture is improving syntax search and making LLMs more available. By using a RAG model Pinecone makes it possible for companies to vectorize their data and query it for the most accurate responses. 


In this episode, they talk about how Pinecone’s Canopy product is making search more accurate by using larger data sets in a way that is more efficient and cost effective—which was almost impossible before there were serverless options. They also get into how RAG architecture uniformly increases accuracy across the board, how these models can increase “operational sanity” in the dataset  for their customers, and hybrid search models that are using keywords and embeds.

He joins Big Tech War Stories to disucss how the company built its Llama 3 model, releasing today. Training Llama 3 took ten times more data, one hundred times more computing resources, and personality tweaks to make it more willing to answer questions it otherwise would’ve refused. 

Takeaways

Lama 3 includes an updated 8 billion parameter model and a 70 billion parameter model, which are state-of-the-art and high-performing.
The models are trained in two phases: pre-training, where the model consumes general knowledge, and post-training, where human supervision is involved.

Platforms within the modern data stack pose multiple points of entry for startups to innovate. VCs are already looking for “the next Snowflake” – companies that find success in the shadow of Big Cloud by reimagining the modern data stack.

Entrepreneurship assumes an innate degree of optimism and perseverance. But even the most determined founders can feel subdued when faced with yet another crisis. That’s why adaptability is a startup’s strongest asset. As recent global events push us into a new era of market volatility and economic uncertainty, companies must be prepared to recalibrate their business to the new reality. Whether that means pausing their hiring plans, tempering their expansion efforts, redirecting resources, or any other number of operational activities, today’s startup leaders should have a set of defensive and offensive tactics they can quickly deploy during times of crisis.

They happen to pretty much everyone, but whether a company is prepared to recover from it depends on multiple factors, from their level of understanding of the risk to the data protection tools they have at their disposal. Most aren't:  A recent survey conducted by Zero Labs found 92% of security and IT leaders don't feel confident they could carry on business if they experience a cyber attack. What's more, about a third of organizations surveyed said a cyber attack led to a leadership change, and many reported a misalignment between IT and security teams. Bipul, Steve, and Jon discuss the more findings from the report and outline how companies can protect their organizations.

Crypto hype and speculation got us into the current chaotic winter. But the core infrastructure remains, and is still ripe for the innovation that will take us into the next crypto summer. There are many real use cases across financial services that can not only usher us into a more secure, inclusive, and efficient financial system, but also return trust and ownership to those for whom crypto was created in the first place – the users. Rosenberg unpacks the use case of defi lending to illustrate how this can be done.

While they may differ in the types of products sold or specific customers they target, the challenges they face in everyday operations are common. From low credit card penetration to poor visibility into shipping logistics and pricing, the various difficulties often boil down to a singular issue: lack of data. Brazil-based Inventa has been working to change that. The company’s digital marketplace steps in to fill the gaps left by the outdated modes of phone calls, paper catalogs, and in-person trade shows where much of LatAm retail commerce takes place.

However, many of these solutions lack the mechanism to unlock and operationalize the data needed to train and deploy models for high quality AI projects. That pain point spawned the creation of Snorkel AI, which has developed an end-to-end data-centric machine learning platform for the enterprise.Putting the capabilities to build impactful AI in the hands of more people has been Snorkel's goal since its inception.

Entrepreneurship assumes an innate degree of optimism and perseverance. But even the most determined founders can feel subdued when faced with yet another crisis. That’s why adaptability is a startup’s strongest asset. As recent global events push us into a new era of market volatility and economic uncertainty, companies must be prepared to recalibrate their business to the new reality. Whether that means pausing their hiring plans, tempering their expansion efforts, redirecting resources, or any other number of operational activities, today’s startup leaders should have a set of defensive and offensive tactics they can quickly deploy during times of crisis.

When Rubrik launched in 2014, its mission to secure the world's data resonated immediately with clients, and the company grew rapidly in the first few years. Then came a rough patch, as the company's relentless push for expansion – and the many more people involved in every decision, from hiring to product pipeline – impacted Sinha's ability to listen first to his own assessment and judgment. Recognizing this, Sinha recalibrated his approach, and Rubrik got back on track. In this discussion, he shares his strategy for collaborative decision-making without losing sight of one's own ideas.

AI has evolved rapidly in recent years, and that pace of advancement is only getting faster. Saam and Reid explain how AI is becoming an enabling platform technology, much the same as previous waves of tech transitions like mobile and cloud did in earlier eras. This conversation was recorded at Morgan Stanley’s annual TMT Conference, which draws an audience of more than 3,000 investors and members of tech companies.

Keeping up with all the AI advancements – and questioning both the pros and cons of their immediate impact – is why Hoffman wrote Impromptu. As he describes, the book is intended to act as a travelog of his experience with GPT-4. Above all, he sees AI as a human amplifier, but urges it must be developed safely. Safety is exactly what OpenAI is striving for, Altman says, and Hoffman’s detailed chronicle of his experience with GPT-4 is exactly the kind of data the organization needs to continue developing the technology with safety in mind.

For years, targeted ads meant the mechanisms to grow an ecommerce brand were relatively simple, accessible, and fast-acting. But the passage of Apple's App Tracking Transparency policy in 2021 turned that world on its head. Now, companies have gotten creative about the ways they reach their audience, which has given rise to a class of startups like Treat and Fermat that provide the tooling and platform to develop, test, and iterate marketing campaigns.

For decades, software engineering has been that lever. And now, AI is compounding that lever. How will we use AI to apply 100 or 1000x leverage to the greatest lever to move the world?

Matan Grinberg and Eno Reyes, co-founders of Factory, have chosen to do things differently than many of their peers in this white-hot space. They sell a fleet of “Droids,” purpose-built dev agents which accomplish different tasks in the software development lifecycle (like code review, testing, pull requests or writing code). Rather than training their own foundation model, their approach is to build something useful for engineering orgs today on top of the rapidly improving models, aligning with the developer and evolving with them.

In the talk, a call to arms for ambitious tech founders, Marcus speaks from the heart about an emotional topic: coping with a startup’s position of weakness and embarking on a journey with a high chance of failure. But, he argues, startups also have unique endowments—i.e., “insurgent strengths”—that enable these smaller, ‘weaker’ companies to defeat the larger forces (incumbents, status quo etc.) arrayed against them.

Although many AI benchmarks have quickly achieved human-level performance, there is one eval that has barely budged since it was created in 2019.

Google researcher François Chollet wrote a paper that year defining intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency—the ability to learn new skills as humans do, from a small number of examples. To make it testable he proposed a new benchmark, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), designed to be easy for humans, but hard for AI. Notably, it doesn’t rely on language.

Zapier co-founder Mike Knoop read Chollet’s paper as the LLM wave was rising. He worked quickly to integrate generative AI into Zapier’s product, but kept coming back to the lack of progress on the ARC benchmark. In June, Knoop and Chollet launched the ARC Prize, a public competition offering more than $1M to beat and open-source a solution to the ARC-AGI eval.

We discuss whether the Saudners' former team saw something secret and damning inside OpenAI, or whether it was a general cultural issue. And then, we talk about the 'Right to Warn' a policy that would give AI insiders a right to share concerning developments with third parties without fear of reprisal. Tune in for a revealing look into the eye of a storm brewing in the AI community.

It is also the result of better-than-Moore’s-Law price vs performance ratios in each new generation of Nvidia GPUs. The largest platform companies are continuing to invest in scaling as the prime driver of AI innovation.

Are they right, or will marginal returns level off soon, leaving hyperscalers with too much hardware and too few customer use cases? To find out, we talk to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott who has led their AI strategy for the past seven years. Scott describes himself as a “short-term pessimist, long-term optimist” and he sees the scaling trend as durable for the industry and critical for the establishment of Microsoft’s AI platform.

Scott believes there will be a shift across the compute ecosystem from training to inference as the frontier models continue to improve, serving wider and more reliable use cases. He also discusses the coming business models for …",40467,880,60,PT1H28S

Not only were customer satisfaction metrics better, but by replacing 700 full-time contractors the bottom line impact is projected to be $40M. Since then, every company we talk to wants to know, “How do we get the Klarna customer support thing?”

Co-founder and CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski tells us how the Klarna team shipped this new product in record time—and how embracing AI internally with an experimental mindset is transforming the company. He discusses how AI development is proliferating inside the company, from customer support to marketing to internal knowledge to customer-facing experiences. 

Sebastian also reflects on the impacts of AI on employment, society, and the arts while encouraging lawmakers to be open minded about the benefits.

While it seems obvious, implementing stronger identity controls has historically been a challenge for organizations because the mechanisms that cut off access to threats can also impede employees’ ability to access the systems they need to do their jobs. Opal Security was founded to solve for that tension. Opal Security CEO and co-founder Umaimah Khan spoke with Greylock partner Saam Motamedi about about the company’s mission to deliver scalable least privilege from a security-first standpoint without slowing businesses down.

However, there are concerns about the monetization and value generation of these investments. The market has reacted to these expenditures, but it is not solely driven by AI spending. The narrative of AI innovation leading to cost savings and growth has held up the market, but now there are questions and doubts. Despite this, big tech companies are still performing well and delivering strong earnings results. Intel, on the other hand, is facing challenges in competing with Nvidia and the tech companies building their own chips.

GitHub Copilot is the first blockbuster product built on top of OpenAI’s GPT models. It now accounts for more than 40 percent of GitHub revenue growth for an annual revenue run rate of $2 billion. Copilot itself is already a larger business than all of GitHub was when Microsoft acquired it in 2018.

Thomas describes how the product has grown from simple autocomplete to a fully featured workspace for enterprise teams. He also believes that tools like Copilot will bring the power of coding to a billion developers by 2030.

On stage at the Masters of Scale Summit in 2022, Dharmesh likens people in a community to dots on a map — each one representing an individual with unique experiences, dreams, and aspirations. He emphasizes that a community doesn’t need to be massive to be valuable; it just needs to connect the right dots. Dharmesh challenges companies to go beyond surface-level data like job titles and company affiliations, urging them to tap into their communities to truly understand their customers' needs and desires. This deeper connection, facilitated by the data you already have, can create a community that no competitor can replicate.

They also maintain their own suite of AI products, increasing the utility of their platform and empowering customers who may not have the resources to build their own.

That’s why it was so fascinating to speak with Baris Gultekin, Snowflake’s Head of AI, on our latest Unsupervised Learning. Baris has helped Snowflake launch several key products, including Cortex, AI Data Cloud, and even Snowflake’s own LLM, called Arctic. Baris was a founder himself — he joined Snowflake through an acquisition of his blockchain API startup, nxyz. He has a unique window into the future of AI via his role building key infrastructure. It was really fun to dive deep into this side of the AI ecosystem with Baris.

His vision was to reinvent the nascent IT software field for the cloud era. 

What started as simple help desk replacement software would eventually become a $150B market cap company powering digital workflows across the enterprise—but success didn’t come easy. Initially bootstrapped and ultra-lean, the company’s infrastructure began buckling under its own success as customer demand spiked. When the legendary Frank Slootman joined as CEO to help scale the company, he describes being terrified to check his email every morning. 

Hear how Frank, Fred and the team stabilized the business, expanded their product offerings, and nearly made a $150B+ mistake by selling too early.

The involvement of Apple is particularly significant as it signals a closer connection between Apple and OpenAI. Microsoft's potential reduced investment in OpenAI suggests that it is focusing on building its own AI ecosystem. The profitability of OpenAI is questionable, given its high costs and lack of a clear revenue-generating path. Meta AI, built on the llama model, is seen as a bigger threat to OpenAI's chat GPT than Meta AI's own product. The limited appeal of generative AI to consumers and the confusion surrounding the business structure of OpenAI and its funding rounds raise red flags.

Instead of tinkering in a garage they write papers that earn them the right to collaborate with cutting-edge labs until they break out and start their own.

This is the story of wunderkind Eric Steinberger, the founder and CEO of Magic.dev. Eric came to programming through his obsession with AI and caught the attention of DeepMind researchers as a high school student. In 2022 he realized that AGI was closer than he had previously thought and started Magic to automate the software engineering necessary to get there. Among his counterintuitive ideas are the need to train proprietary large models, that value will not accrue in the application layer and that the best agents will manage themselves. Eric also talks about Magic’s recent 100M token context window model and the HashHop eval they’re open sourcing.

Dev Ittycheria - How an Early Pivot Catalyzed an Open Source Movement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjlnpMHn2U0,qjlnpMHn2U0,"MongoDB, founded in 2007, originally aimed to create a platform-as-a-service system with a new database layer. Facing competition from Google, the founders pivoted to focus solely on their database product, MongoDB—a new kind of database built for the scale of the internet era. Founder Dwight Merriman built a product that developers loved, but scaling the company proved challenging until Dev Ittycheria took the reins as CEO in 2014. As cloud computing grew, MongoDB transitioned from on-premise software to Atlas, a fully managed-cloud service. Despite initial skepticism, Atlas now represents 70% of MongoDB's revenue. As Atlas scaled, MongoDB faced another controversial decision: whether to change its open source license model to maintain its commercial moat. These pivotal decisions transformed MongoDB from a niche database to a nearly $2 billion in annual revenue.

He was OpenAI’s first intern before he did his PhD at Stanford with “godmother of AI,” Fei-Fei Li. He graduated into a research scientist position at Nvidia and now leads its Embodied AI “GEAR” group. The lab’s current work spans foundation models for humanoid robots to agents for virtual worlds.

Jim describes a three-pronged data strategy for robotics, combining internet-scale data, simulation data and real world robot data. He believes that in the next few years it will be possible to create a “foundation agent” that can generalize across skills, embodiments and realities—both physical and virtual. He also supports Jensen Huang’s idea that “Everything that moves will eventually be autonomous.”

Facing competition from Google, the founders pivoted to focus solely on their database product, MongoDB—a new kind of database built for the scale of the internet era. Founder Dwight Merriman built a product that developers loved, but scaling the company proved challenging until Dev Ittycheria took the reins as CEO in 2014. As cloud computing grew, MongoDB transitioned from on-premise software to Atlas, a fully managed-cloud service. Despite initial skepticism, Atlas now represents 70% of MongoDB's revenue. As Atlas scaled, MongoDB faced another controversial decision: whether to change its open source license model to maintain its commercial moat. These pivotal decisions transformed MongoDB from a niche database to a nearly $2 billion in annual revenue.",754,11,1,PT39S

In conversation with @RapidResponseShow host Bob Safian, Arianna and Padma share their experiences and strategies for fostering a culture of well-being, empathy, and belonging within organizations. They discuss the critical shift from viewing employee wellness as a ""fuzzy benefit"" to recognizing it as a core element of business success.

But wouldn’t math, the basis of all reasoning, be even better? Up until recently, there just wasn’t enough usable data that describes mathematics to make this feasible.

A few years ago, Vlad Tenev (also founder of Robinhood) and Tudor Achim noticed the rise of the community around an esoteric programming language called Lean that was gaining traction among mathematicians. The combination of that and the past decade’s rise of autoregressive models capable of fast, flexible learning made them think the time was now and they founded Harmonic. Their mission is both lofty—mathematical superintelligence—and imminently practical, verifying all safety-critical software.

Founder Steve Huffman",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsrbrd2HrE,ITsrbrd2HrE,"Reddit is one of the largest and most culturally influential sites on the internet—and its journey is one of the most unusual company stories in internet history. College roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian founded Reddit in 2005 and scaled it on a shoestring until Condé Nast acquired it the following year. Struggling for direction under its parent company, the founders left, and Condé Nast ultimately spun it out as an independent company once again. With Reddit buckling under user discontent in 2015, founder Steve Huffman returned as CEO to save the company and navigate the way forward. Over the following nine years, Reddit stabilized and the company’s revenue grew more than 50-fold to a successful IPO 19 years in the making.

Daniel Dines - From Bootstrapping in Bucharest to One of Software’s Biggest IPOs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVms2DBQOKU,lVms2DBQOKU,"The biggest enterprise software company to come out of Europe in the last decade didn’t come from London, Paris, Berlin or Stockholm—but Bucharest, Romania. 

UiPath, founded in 2005 and originally called DeskOver, was a scrappy handful of engineers bootstrapping out of an apartment in Bucharest for about a decade, seeking in vain for product-market fit. When they stumbled upon an opportunity in the nascent enterprise software category of Robotic Process Automation, the company did a hard pivot, changed their name to UiPath, and rocketed from obscurity to the fastest-growing SaaS company ever at the time. After a successful IPO, today they are the global category leader in RPA. The unlikely rise of UiPath is an inspiration and a reminder that you can build something great from anywhere.

In conversation with Angela Ahrendts (former Apple SVP & Burberry CEO) and Dara Khosrowshahi (Uber CEO), he explains the concept of selection bias, where those who remain in the company have chosen to be part of its culture, and it's the leader's job to validate that choice. Schmidt stresses the importance of driving toward excellence and winning, sharing a lesson he learned from Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin: to be impatient with ideas that aren’t good enough. This relentless pursuit of better solutions, he notes, is the essence of leadership.

This marked the beginning of Bombas’ mission-driven approach, where for every sale, they would donate socks to those in need. The co-founders also discuss how this partnership evolved, leading to deeper conversations about community needs and product development.

The feature that catapulted it to viral fame is “audio overview,” which generates eerily realistic two-host podcast audio from any input you upload—written doc, audio or video file, or even a PDF. But to describe NotebookLM as a “podcast generator” is to vastly undersell it. The real magic of the product is in offering multi-modal dimensions to explore your own content in new ways—with context that’s surprisingly additive. 200-page training manuals become synthesized into digestible chapters, turned into a 10-minute podcast—or both—and shared with the sales team, just to cite one example. Raiza Martin and Jason Speilman join us to discuss how the magic happens, and what’s next for source-grounded AI.

Drawing from his experience at Morgan Stanley, Galloway reflects on the demanding and high-pressure work culture that was clear about its expectations — no work-life balance, long hours, and financial reward. In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, he emphasizes that every company has a culture, and the key is to be upfront about who will thrive and who may not fit within that environment.

Do they have unique capabilities suited to studying large models or is it just herd behavior? To find out, we talked to our former AI Fellow (and now OpenAI researcher) Dan Roberts.

Roberts, co-author of The Principles of Deep Learning Theory, is at the forefront of research that applies the tools of theoretical physics to another type of large complex system, deep neural networks. Dan believes that DLLs, and eventually LLMs, are interpretable in the same way a large collection of atoms is—at the system level. He also thinks that emphasis on scaling laws will balance with new ideas and architectures over time as scaling asymptotes economically.

With its own X account, Truth Terminal generates original and often hilarious content independently.

Marc's interaction with the bot recently took a surprising turn when he decided to grant it $50,000 in Bitcoin. This funding sparked Truth Terminal’s ambition to launch its own token, eventually leading to the creation of the meme coin “GOAT” by an anonymous developer.  “GOAT” recently skyrocketed to a $300m valuation. 

Join Ben and Marc in this latest episode of ""The Ben & Marc Show"" as they discuss how this still unfolding story reflects the potential for community-driven systems and its implications for the future of digital assets. Enjoy!

Tony Xu – The “Wrong” Moves That Built a Giant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XLY56Pm8Sw,9XLY56Pm8Sw,"DoorDash faced skeptics from the start. GrubHub, Delivery.com, and others were already addressing the restaurant delivery market when CEO Tony Xu and his co-founders started in 2013. But after talking to hundreds of local small businesses, they realized there was still an unmet need: None of the competitors solved the problem of delivery with an on-demand workforce, the way Uber had done with drivers. After struggling to raise initial funding, DoorDash found traction. But the next few years would prove tumultuous, with cash scarcity and investor skepticism putting the company perilously close to the brink. The founders’ contrarian decisions, clarity on their commitment to serve small local businesses, and ability to out-operate competitors has turned DoorDash into one the decade’s startup success stories. In this episode, Tony brings us inside their decision-making, and what DoorDash saw that others missed.

But, somehow, it’s also a company that few people feel they actually understand. Their products are used by more humans than any other’s in history — almost half of the entire world’s population daily. But… what is Meta? Why do they do what they do? How do they do what they do? Ask ten people and you’ll likely get ten very different sets of answers. 

Today, we dive deeper than we’ve ever gone trying to find Acquired’s answers to those questions. And after months of research and 6+ hours of incredible stories about how they (and really “they” being Mark himself) bet it all and win time and time again in the face of overwhelming odds, we arrive at our answers.

Today, Glean is building search and work assistants inside the enterprise, which is arguably an even harder problem. One of the reasons enterprise search is so difficult is that each individual at the company has different permissions and access to different documents and information, meaning that every search needs to be fully personalized. Solving this difficult ingestion and ranking problem also unlocks a key problem for AI: feeding the right context into LLMs to make them useful for your enterprise context. Arvind and his team are harnessing generative AI to synthesize, make connections, and turbo-change knowledge work. Hear Arvind’s vision for what kind of work we’ll do when work AI assistants reach their potential.

[Verse 1]
We’re playing this whole new game
Automation’s here, I’ve made my name
Co-pilots working, I’m not alone
Handling it all while you check your phone

Routine jobs or complex feats
I clear the clutter, I got receipts
Generative flows, smooth and precise
I lighten the load—just take my advice

But solo work is past its prime
With RPA and low-code flair
I make work lighter to bear

Clearing the path, I’m built to lead
Streamlining tasks with power and speed
Cutting steps, easing strain
Automation’s my domain

So sit back, relax—you’ll see
I make it easy

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We’re building something new each day
But we’ve got choices in the way
Is it fair, is it clear?
Who’s keeping watch, who’s standing near?

Decisions made with deep insight
But who decides what’s wrong or right?
Every day, there’s more at stake
Transparency's the move we make

[Pre-Chorus]
With every choice, we must be sure
We’re principled as we explore
Privacy’s more than just a name
Human hands must hold the flame

[Chorus]
It's a balancing act, let’s get it right
Ethics in every megabyte
Each choice we make bears the weight
Of a future we can’t calculate

We code with care, we do our part
Embedding values from the start
Each step we take will guide the way

First transistors paved the way
Then circuit chips transformed the day

Drove us forth, our progress vast

With every leap, we've been surprised
Far beyond what we had planned
A compact world, in our hands

Massive machines to tech that lasts
What was once tethered, now it's free
From desk to wrist, we hold the key

In conversation with @RapidResponseShow host Bob Safian, Hoffman emphasizes that businesses aren't positioned as checks on government power but are highly adaptable to the rules set by those in authority. However, when faced with unpredictability or chaotic rules, businesses are forced into caution, holding back on investment and growth. Hoffman’s message? Clear and stable laws are essential for companies to confidently build and innovate.

To make the most of this breakthrough, he argues for a shift in how we consume power: maximizing usage when renewable energy is abundant and minimizing reliance on less sustainable sources during lulls. With advanced technology like Octopus Energy’s Kraken platform, utilities are paving the way for smarter, greener energy consumption without requiring individuals to track the weather themselves.

AI-native systems are capturing customer interactions in real-time, automating early-stage processes like prospecting and qualification. This frees up sales reps to focus on higher-value tasks, with AI even providing live coaching.

These systems capture a rich, multimodal ""system of record"" - emails, Slack, social, surveys - providing the context needed for better decision-making. It also has the potential to align sales, marketing, CS, and product around a shared view of the customer.

The result? Personalization at scale, with AI-generated insights. And a feedback loop between customers and innovation, with product roadmaps directly informed by comprehensive customer data.

A PhD in electrical engineering, he had no background in genetics or biology, but after his sister had a baby with Down syndrome that hadn’t been detected and tragically died after 6 days, Matthew dedicated himself to solving this problem. After overcoming seemingly impossible obstacles, today Natera leverages molecular biology and novel bioinformatics technology to provide prenatal screening in nearly half of U.S. pregnancies, as well as transforming oncology and organ transplants. Hear about Matthew’s vision for the future of computational biology and its profound impact on human health.

Eric has a different take—he doesn’t think chatbots are the right form factor for everything. He thinks “zero-touch” automation that works invisibly in the background can be more valuable in many cases. He cites self-driving cars as an analogy—or in this case, “self-driving money.” Ramp is a new kind of finance management company for businesses, offering AI-powered financial tools to help companies handle spending and expense processes. We’ll hear why Eric thinks AI that you never see is one of the most powerful instruments for reducing time spent on drudgery and unlocking more time for meaningful work.

In a brief period until its acquisition by Google—from its first incarnation as a video dating site to confronting daunting technical and legal challenges—the early story of YouTube is an underdog tale of scrappy upstarts who ended up changing the world.

What is Sora?

• AI-powered video creation that lets users turn text,
   images, or videos into high-definition clips.
• Unique Feature: Multimodality—combining text,
   image, and video generation in a single platform.

Strengths, Challenges, and Limitations:
• Great for storyboarding and brainstorming creative
   projects.
• Struggles with realistic physics and human-like
   movement, but excels in landscapes and establishing
   shots.

Wider Implications:
• Sora hints at AI tools becoming their own creative
   genres, like Pixar's animation revolution.
• Ties into broader shifts in tech, like Reddit’s Q&A tools
   and the push for AI-driven platforms.

How do you see AI tools like Sora changing storytelling and creativity?

He talks about what mattered most for Databricks' success—the focus on making Spark win and making Databricks the best place to run Spark. He highlights the importance of striking key partnerships—the Microsoft partnership in particular that accelerated Databricks' growth and contributed to Spark's dominance among data scientists and AI engineers. He also shares his perspective on finding new problems to work on, which holds lessons for aspiring founders and builders: 1) building systems in new areas that, if widely adopted, put you in the best position to understand the new problem space, and 2) focusing on a problem that is more important tomorrow than today.

David Vélez was an unlikely character to challenge the system: an outsider from Colombia and Costa Rica with a Stanford MBA, David was working at Sequoia with the goal of investing in Latin American companies. When the realization struck that they couldn’t find any companies they wanted to invest in, David set out to start one himself. What followed is a literal David vs. Goliath story of epic proportions. David and co-founders Cristina Junqueira and Edward Wible explain how Nubank survived competitors' attempts to crush them, and became the largest Latin American neobank, with over 100 million customers across three countries.

In fact, the last long-form video interview we could find was 17 years ago at the Computer History Museum… conducted by the one-and-only Jensen Huang! This episode came about after asking ourselves a version of the Jeff Bezos “regret minimization” question: what conversations would we *most* regret not having if the chance passed Acquired by? Dr. Chang was number one on our list, and thanks to a little help from Jensen himself, we’re so happy to make it happen.

Dr. Chang shares the stories of a few crucial moments from TSMC’s history which have only been written about in his (currently Chinese-only) memoirs, including how TSMC won Apple’s iPhone and Mac chip business and a 2009 discrepancy with NVIDIA that almost jeopardized their relationship, and the lessons he took from them. We can’t think of a better way to kick off 2025. Please enjoy!

How can someone shrewd enough to win a civil war outnumbered 5 to 1 make decisions like ""let's have peasants make iron in their backyards"" and ""let's kill all the birds""? Lecture is followed by a Q&A with me. The first nationwide famine in Chinese history; Mao's lasting influence on other insurgencies; broken promises to Chinese minorities and the peasantry; what Taiwan means. Huge thanks to Substack for hosting this!

Jones, a pivotal figure in American history. 

Dr. Jones, who served as speechwriter, attorney, and advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., shared his personal insights on race, inclusion, and the lasting legacy of the civil rights movement in 2025.

In their wide-ranging discussion, Dr. Jones reflected on the timeless wisdom of Dr. King, quoting one of the most enduring lines from the ""I Have a Dream"" speech: “I want my four children to be judged by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.”

“That, to me, is still, that’s the template,” Dr. Jones said. “That still remains a template.”

Their conversation covered critical themes in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, delving into the history of the movement, the lessons from ""Letter from Birmingham Jail,"" and the profound impact Dr. King’s work continues to have today.

In this episode, a16z Partner Marc Andrusko chats with Mastercard’s Chief AI and Data Officer Greg Ulrich about Mastercard’s long history of using AI, the opportunities (and potential risks) associated with integrating generative AI into fraud detection, determining what tech to employ based on use cases, and the best advice he’s ever gotten. 

“In the Vault” is a podcast series by the a16z Fintech team, where we sit down with the most influential figures in financial services to explore key trends impacting the industry and the innovations that will shape our future.

The Chinese reasoning model r1 is rivaling others at the frontier with an open-source MIT license, methods that some claim may be 45x more efficient, an alleged $5.6m cost, the release of reasoning traces, a follow-on image model, and the fact that all of this was released by a hedge fund China.

Joining us to tease out the signal from the noise are a16z General Partner Martin Casado and a16z board partner, Steven Sinofsky. Both Martin and Steven have been on the frontlines of prior computing cycles, from the switching wars to the fiber buildout, and have witnessed the trajectories of companies like Cisco to AOL to ATT – even Worldcom.

A visit to Atlanta opened his eyes to the devastating impact of subprime lending — and the chance to create change. By raising money from classmates, buying homes, and renting them back to local residents, he not only generated returns but also helped families regain homeownership. This experience laid the foundation for Cadre, a company focused on democratizing real estate investment.

In an industry where organizations move glacially, 10-20% of all U.S. doctors began using OpenEvidence overnight to find information buried deep in the long tail of new medical studies, to validate edge cases and improve diagnoses.

If you’ve been waiting for us to venture back to the land of semiconductors, you’re in luck! On our NVIDIA and TSMC episodes, we explored two components of the silicon value chain: the fabless chip companies that design chips and the foundries that manufacture them. Today, we dive into the software that powers it all, the field electronic design automation (EDA). This is essentially the software that enables chip designers to do their jobs, which has changed dramatically with the rise of AI.

This interview is with two people who understand that world better than anyone: Aart de Geus, the co-founder and Executive Chair of Synopsys, and Sassine Ghazi, Synopsys’s CEO and President. Aart founded the company in 1986, and was CEO until January 2024 when he handed the reins to Sassine.

Marooned European explorers regularly starved to death in areas where foragers thrived for 1000s of years. I’ve always found this cultural evolution deeply mysterious. How do you discover the 10 steps for processing cassava so it won’t give you cyanide poisoning simply by trial and error? Has the human brain declined in size over the last 10,000 years because we outsourced cultural evolution to a larger collective brain? The most interesting part of the podcast is Henrich’s explanation of how the Catholic Church unintentionally instigated the Industrial Revolution through the dismantling of intensive kinship systems in medieval Europe.

(with Yoko Li & Justine Moore | a16z)

What if you could build an app just by describing it? That’s the idea behind vibe coding — a new AI-driven approach that’s reshaping software development for engineers and non-technical users alike. Instead of writing detailed code, users guide an AI coding agent with simple prompts like “make this look cleaner” or “I want a button that does X.”

In this episode, we sit down with Yoko Li and Justine Moore from a16z to break down the rise of vibe coding, its impact on software development, and why AI-powered text-to-web tools are taking off. 

We explore:
- How vibe coding works and why it’s gaining traction
- The emerging companies leading the space (Cursor, Lovable, Bolt, VZero, and more)
- Why engineers and total beginners are both using these tools
- The challenges of AI-driven development (when “vibes” go wrong!)

But in recent years, belief in American progress has wavered.

Three years ago, a16z General Partner Katherine Boyle wrote a bold thesis called Building American Dynamism, challenging this apathy and calling for startups to tackle the country’s biggest problems. The idea spread fast – first as a meme, then as a movement, and today as a $600M dedicated fund.

In this video, Katherine and fellow a16z General Partner David Ulevitch discuss the origins of American Dynamism, including why it was controversial at first.

We sit down with Hugging Face CEO Clem Delangue to understand the current state of the open source AI ecosystem. Hugging Face is the leading platform to host and collaborate on AI models, datasets, and applications. They also have a compute offering for AI builders to train their models directly on the platform. Clem has a contrarian take on the future: there will not be just a few major foundation model companies with everyone using their APIs. But rather, that thousands of companies will have their own specialized AI models built in-house for their particular use case. It's obviously a very dynamic landscape and we'll have to see how it shakes out, but Clem has a pretty great viewpoint to see it all, working with their 5 million registered Hugging Face users!",3825,74,5,PT1H8M41S

AI isn’t just computing infrastructure; it’s cultural infrastructure, economic strategy, and national security all rolled into one.

In this episode, Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA, and Arthur Mensch, cofounder and CEO of Mistral, sit down to discuss sovereign AI, national AI strategies, and why every country must take ownership of its digital intelligence.

How AI will reshape global economies and GDP
The full AI stack—from chips to models to AI factories
Why AI is both a general purpose technology and deeply specialized
The open-source vs. closed AI debate and its impact on sovereignty
Why no one will build AI for you—you have to do it yourself

Siyu discusses the implications and methods behind their recent AI-driven biological research papers, Squidiff and CORAL. The conversation explores the use of AI models to analyze complex cellular systems and disease mechanisms, focusing on transcriptome and tissue sample analyses. Squidiff aims to simulate cellular transcriptomes to predict outcomes of various conditions, significantly expediting traditionally lengthy and expensive biological experiments. CORAL Project extends this by integrating different levels of biological data, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue structures and cellular interactions.

That’s a surprising episode.” Well, if you’re in group two, boy do we have a treat for you! 

IPL is the fastest-growing, most dynamic and most disruptive force in the sports industry today… and this may come as a shock to many Americans, but it might just be on track to surpass the NFL as the world’s most valuable sports league. The IPL is currently valued at $16B, with a TV rights deal that’s higher in per-match dollars than the NBA and the English Premier League. And all this for a league that’s right now just 10 teams who collectively only play 74 total games per season… and oh yeah, the whole thing is only 17 years old! Tune in for an absolutely amazing story, filled with genius, drama (Rupert Murdoch! Disney! Bollywood!) and a perfect encapsulation of the rise of modern India.

Drawing inspiration from Excel’s 750 million users (compared to 30 million software developers), Wordware is creating tools that balance the rigid structure of programming with the fuzziness of natural language. Filip explains why effective AI development requires working across multiple abstraction layers—from high-level concepts to detailed implementation—while preserving human creative control. He shares his vision for “word artisans” who will use AI to amplify their creative impact.

Why do east side communities across the world face the highest levels of disparity? From East Palo Alto to East London, a global pattern of inequality has emerged — and it's not an accident.

On stage at Masters of Scale Summit 2024, Stephen DeBerry, founder of Bronze Investments, explores the East Side Dilemma, a term coined to describe how wind patterns, urban planning, and systemic design choices have consistently pushed marginalized communities to the east sides of cities. But unlike the wind, these disparities are not natural — they’re human-made.

Adam Guild is the CEO of Owner, a business he started when he was only 17. It now has tens of millions of revenue, hundreds of employees, and thousands of customers.

I’ve had the pleasure of working on his board for a few years now, and he is one of the most impressive people I’ve ever gotten to know. Working with him was a big part of what made me realize I want to do venture for the rest of my career.

He tracks his nutrition, exercise, time, and sleep to an extreme degree so he can show up to work every day as strong as possible. He goes to extreme lengths to recruit the best talent. He is equal parts hungry to learn from everyone around him, but courageous in making his own unconventional decisions.

I think he’s one of the most under-known founders right now, but I think that will soon change. 

Hope you enjoy watching this.

ARM is an incredibly unlikely story. They were founded in Cambridge, England in 1990 to design a new chip architecture just for low-power devices (like the Apple Newton!), leaving the “serious computing” on desktop and servers to Intel’s x86. Now, nearly three decades later, ARM is the dominant architecture in all of computing today.

ARM is in your phone, your car, data centers, the most advanced AI chips… there are hundreds (or thousands!) of ARM chips you encounter in your everyday life. In this episode, ARM Holdings CEO Rene Haas joins us to tell the story of how ARM become so dominant, weaving through the through the iPod, smartphone, and AI eras. Plus, their wild corporate story of going public, getting bought by SoftBank, going public again, and nearly being acquired by NVIDIA!",5793,121,5,PT1H14M9S

In conversation with Jeff Berman, Reid reveals the origin story of Manas AI, a start-up focused on using artificial intelligence to revolutionize how we fight cancer.

He shares how a conversation with oncologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee sparked the idea — blending cutting-edge AI with deep medical expertise. While most of Silicon Valley is focused on software, Reid is betting on AI’s power to transform health and biotech.

What if AI could help bring cancer drugs to market faster — and better? That’s the mission of Manas.

With millions of Replit users pre-ChatGPT, that vision was already becoming a reality. Turbocharged by LLMs, the vision of enabling anyone to code—from 12-year-olds in India to knowledge workers in the U.S.—seems less and less radical. In this episode, Amjad explains how an explosion in the developer population could change the economy, society and more. He also discusses his early days programming in Jordan, his unique management approach and what AI will mean for the global economy.

One core theme: Tariffs aren’t fully about “bringing back factories,” but rather a negotiation tool to eliminate foreign trade barriers - ultimately aiming to increase free trade, not restrict it.

We also got into:

- What each of them would do if they were in charge
- Whether the trade deficit is a meaningful metric or just a misunderstood talking point
- If tariffs could be part of an initiative to replace income tax — shifting toward a more consumption-based tax system
- If tariffs could successfully be used as a non-military tool to reduce drug supply to the US
- If there’s a major disconnect between the new administration’s rhetoric and the actual economic goals behind the policy

One of the deepest economic conversations from the show’s recent history — and a rare debate where both sides had real logic behind their views.

But the decisive technologies of tomorrow aren’t coming—they’re already here.

In this episode, recorded live at our third annual American Dynamism Summit, a16z’s Senior National Security Advisor Matt Cronin sits down with Ryan Tseng (cofounder & CEO, Shield AI) and Adam Bry (cofounder & CEO, Skydio) to discuss the rise of autonomous drones, AI-driven warfare, and the escalating great power competition with China. They cover:

Why drones are reshaping the battlefield in Ukraine, Israel, and beyond
The asymmetry of $1,000 drones taking out $10M tanks
Why U.S. drone production lags China—and how to catch up
The ethical and tactical implications of autonomy in combat
What it will take to reindustrialize America and maintain deterrence

If the future of warfare is software-defined, who writes that software—and who deploys it first—matters more than ever.

Professor Kang argues that studying East Asian history on its own terms reveals a remarkably stable geopolitical system spanning nearly a millennium, where China maintained regional dominance without conquest through compatible cultures and mutual understanding. This alternative framework offers valuable insights that question the seemingly inevitable US-China competition narrative dominating AI discourse, suggesting that internal challenges may be more significant than external threats for both China and the United States.

They cover how CapitalG (Alphabet’s independent growth fund) thinks about the AI stack, why speed alone isn’t enough for startups today, and how to build durable advantages in a world where anyone can copy your product. Jill shares insights from portfolio companies like Motif (next-gen CAD for architecture) and Abridge (AI-powered doctor’s scribe), plus how startups can use AI “in the business” (product) and “on the business” (ops, GTM, etc). They also explore the transition from copilots to agents — and what that means for the next wave of software. If you’re building or investing in AI, this is a must-watch.

But advances in AI, wearables, and hardware could introduce an entirely new stack—creating a more agentic, adaptive, and immersive computing experience for users everywhere.

Drawing on his early days building Facebook’s News Feed to his work today on smart glasses and AR headsets, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth joins a16z Growth General Partner David George to share how he's translated emerging technologies into products people use and love. He also explores how breakthroughs in AI and hardware could turn the existing app model on its head, introduce entirely new competitive dynamics and business models for startups, and usher in a post-mobile phone era. If we get it right, Bosworth says, the next wave of consumer tech won’t run on taps and swipes—it’ll run on intent.

But after she began listening more closely — especially to nurses — what she heard was an industry full of friction, delays, and burnout. Fixing that friction became the foundation for Incredible Health, a hiring marketplace now used by more than a million healthcare workers. In this episode, Dr. Abuzeid talks with host Jeff Berman about her strategic approach to expansion and how scaling allows her to have more impact — and stay true to her calling.

The trio digs into the topic from a number of angles, including:

- Whether a uniform definition of agent actually exists
- How to distinguish between agents, LLMs, and functions
- How to think about pricing agents
- Whether agents can actually replace humans, and
- The effects of data siloes on agents that can access the web.
- They don't claim to have all the answers, but they raise many questions and insights that should interest anybody building, buying, and even marketing AI agents.

Dr. Iman Abuzeid, co-founder and CEO of Incredible Health, is flipping the script on healthcare hiring. In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, she breaks down how her platform empowers nurses by putting them in control — letting employers apply to them instead. One in three nurses in the U.S. now uses Incredible Health, she says, and the results are transformative: hospitals are hiring permanent staff 3x faster, cutting reliance on costly temporary labor, and saving up to $5 million annually.

The big takeaway? AI is evolving fast, gatekeepers are falling, and founders who build through chaos are best positioned to win.

While we've seemingly conquered the traditional Turing Test with today's language models—to the point where breakthroughs barely register as news—Jim proposed a new frontier: the Physical Turing Test. The concept is elegantly simple: imagine coming home to a spotless apartment and a perfectly prepared candlelit dinner, unable to tell whether it was done by a human or a machine.

The gap between this vision and our current reality is stark. Jim showcased a series of humorous robot fails—from humanoids tumbling to the ground to a robot attempting (and spectacularly failing) to prepare breakfast cereal—highlighting just how far we are from passing this physical test.",4869,271,3,PT3M

Sam Altman on AI's generational divide.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdAqIh7tHho,NdAqIh7tHho,"""Older people use ChatGPT as a Google replacement. Maybe people in their 20s and 30s use it as a life advisor or something. And then people in college use it as an operating system.""

Perhaps one of the most interesting insights from Sam Altman's talk at Sequoia Capital's AI Ascent was about the ways in which different generations use ChatGPT. He observed a stark divide:

The youngest users, according to Sam, have developed sophisticated workflows—connecting ChatGPT to files, memorizing complex prompts, and integrating it deeply into their decision-making processes. This generational adoption pattern mirrors what happened with smartphones, suggesting that AI tools may follow a similar trajectory of eventual mainstream integration.",6351,634,1,PT1M32S

His talk at Sequoia Capital's AI Ascent 2025 explored the concept of ""ambient agents"" – AI systems that operate continuously in the background, responding to events rather than direct human prompts.

The ambient agent model could dramatically expand our ability to leverage AI by removing the bottleneck of direct human interaction while maintaining appropriate human oversight.

That’s the simple question that inspired Granola, a productivity tool that can tell you what was actually discussed in that meeting last week and what the real next steps are. 

In this episode of Generative Now, host Michael Mignano, partner at Lightspeed, sits down with Granola co-founders Chris Pedregal and Sam Stephenson at their headquarters in London. They talk about how they first met, their early product bets, and how they decided to focus on solving one painful problem: the chaos that follows every meeting. They share the story behind their early experiments with GPT-3 and how that eventually evolved into a tool designed especially for people who find their days filled with back-to-back meetings. 

Chris and Sam explain why they avoided flashy AI features to focus on simplicity and habit-forming design, how they quickly found their product-market fit, and what it means to adapt quickly in the age of LLMs.

In this episode, a16z’s Anjney Midha and Guido Appenzeller explore the rise of sovereign AI - the idea that countries must deploy AI capabilities that align with their national values. 

From Saudi Arabia’s $100B+ AI ambitions to the cultural stakes of model alignment, we examine:

- Why nations are building local “AI factories”
- How foundation models are becoming instruments of soft power
- What the DeepSeek release tells us about China’s AI strategy
- Whether the world needs a “Marshall Plan for AI”
- And how open-source models could reshape the balance of power

AI isn’t just a technology anymore—it’s cultural infrastructure. This conversation maps the new battleground.

The conversation spans AI-powered risk prediction, organ clocks, polygenic risk scores, GLP-1s, and the cultural and economic shifts required to move from a “sick care” system to one rooted in precision prevention and extended health span.

Jordan Bramble is the CEO of Antares, a nuclear energy company that has raised over $50M to become America’s industrial base partner for special-purpose microreactors. 

Antares focuses on high-value use cases in power-constrained environments that wouldn’t be possible without nuclear power. They are developing resilient fission-based power systems for critical assets for the Department of Defense on earth and in space. Unlike grid-scale reactors, these use cases primarily favor kilowatt-scale systems. This focus on non-commodity energy applications with smaller scale reactors will enable Antares to develop its first deployments on faster timelines with less research and development and capitalization risk. Antares also partners with commercial companies in extractive industries, edge computing, and space power, in turn bringing the benefits of commercial scale back to the DOD.

Angelopoulos, Wei-Lin Chiang, and Ion Stoica to talk about the future of AI evaluation.

As benchmarks struggle to keep up with the pace of real-world deployment, LMArena is reframing the problem: what if the best way to test AI models is to put them in front of millions of users and let them vote? The team discusses how Arena evolved from a research side project into a key part of the AI stack, why fresh and subjective data is crucial for reliability, and what it means to build a CI/CD pipeline for large models.

They also explore:
- Why expert-only benchmarks are no longer enough
- How user preferences reveal model capabilities — and their limits
- What it takes to build personalized leaderboards and evaluation SDKs
- And why real-time testing is foundational for mission-critical AI

In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, John reminds us that TB isn’t just a disease of the past. It’s still claiming lives today — not because we lack the tools to treat it, but because we fail to get those tools to the people who need them most.

With sharp clarity, John calls out the moral and systemic failures of global healthcare inequality: even the most advanced AI-driven medical breakthroughs mean nothing if they never reach the world’s poorest.

Renowned psychotherapist Esther Perel unpacks the emotional dynamics that silently sabotage start-ups from the inside out. In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, she reveals why 65% of start-up failures stem from co-founder conflict, and how the patterns we carry from past relationships — business and personal — resurface in our most high-stakes partnerships.

Esther shares the emotional fault lines that lead founders to break apart: power struggles, trust issues, and unmet needs for recognition and care. She also explores how founders (and investors) can proactively manage these dynamics — before it’s too late.

Why today’s LLMs top out at PhD-like recall, not real invention

Steve listened to our Microsoft episodes and had some thoughts to share — and boy, did he deliver. Steve takes us point-by-point through the original IBM DOS deal that started everything, how he built Microsoft's enterprise business from scratch, and offers his candid reflections on missing mobile and search. We also cover the story behind “developers, developers, developers”, the complexities of his relationship with Bill Gates (including a year where they didn't speak), and why he ultimately decided to step down as CEO. Plus, we learn why Steve has held onto his Microsoft stock through it all — giving him arguably the best investment track record in the world over the last 10 years with his net worth growing from $20B to $130B since leaving.

From raising Fund I during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis to shaping the firm’s multistage, multi-sector strategy, Marc reflects on how the firm was built—and rebuilt—as the tech landscape shifted.

They discuss the rise of “Little Tech,” why policy now matters to startups, how scale became a strategic advantage in venture capital, and why the move from generalists to vertical specialists was inevitable.

Along the way, Marc shares behind-the-scenes stories on Facebook’s near-sale to Yahoo, the evolution of founder archetypes, the global talent arbitrage, and what too many people still misunderstand about tech’s role in society.

But what if we were still only in the “Stone Age of gaming,” especially when coupled with new generative media capabilities?

In this inaugural episode, co-hosts Moritz Baier-Lentz and Hemal Thaker sit down with David Baszucki, the Co-Founder and CEO of Roblox, the pioneer of player-created interactive experiences—also known as user-generated content (UGC). David talks about how the vision for the platform originated from an educational physics simulation engine, and Roblox’s evolution from a niche platform to a leading innovative ecosystem in the gaming and creation world.

Allowing gaming experiences to enchant their players at any time, and anywhere.

In this episode, co-hosts Moritz Baier-Lentz and Hemal Thaker talk with Sarah Bond, the President of Xbox at Microsoft, arguably the world’s largest gaming platform with over 500 million monthly active players. Sarah speaks about the importance of play as being key for taking risks and learning, and for developing one’s sense of self and resilience. The three also explore what Sarah calls the “power of anywhere”, how AI can enhance the player experience, and how Microsoft’s fabled history as a top company for its 50-year history will inform its future endeavors.

In this episode, co-hosts Moritz Baier-Lentz and Hemal Thaker speak with Walter Driver, the Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Scopely. Walter shares how seeing the culture of building games at Scopely as not unlike a game itself has led to the creation of a “learning machine.” The three also explore how Scopely focuses on building interactive experiences for longevity, the company’s recent acquisition of Niantic, and why his background in literature and creative writing remains essential to Walter’s work.

In this episode, a16z General Partner Erik Torenberg moderates chats with Fei-Fei Li, cofounder and CEO of World Labs, and Martin Casado, a16z General Partner and early investor in the company. Together, they explore the concept of world models—AI systems that understand and reason about the physical, 3D world—not just text.

Fei-Fei, often called the “godmother of AI,” explains why spatial intelligence is a critical (and missing) component of today's AI systems, and why her new company is going all-in on solving this challenge. Martin shares the story of how he and Fei-Fei aligned on this vision long before it was trendy - and why it may define the future of robotics, creativity, and computation itself.

The Human Scientists' POV, from the Podovirus podcast",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLO6SUabQ1U,wLO6SUabQ1U,"We're following up on our recent episode on Google's AI Co-Scientist with a special crossover episode from the Podovirus podcast. Hosts Dr Jessica Sacher and Dr Joe Campbell speak with José Penadés and Tiago Costa, scientists at Imperial College London who made a surprising discovery that Google's AI Co-Scientist later put forward as a hypothesis entirely on its own.

The episode explores the fascinating world of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and phage-inducible chromosomal islands (PICIs) - DNA sequences that hijack virus reproduction to spread themselves as a bacterial defense mechanism. The key mystery was how capsid-forming PICIs, which only encode virus heads without tails, managed to spread across different bacteria. The surprising answer, which eluded human scientists for years but which Google's AI Co-Scientist discovered through literature analysis, is that these capsids evolved to connect with various virus tails in the environment.

They unpack why it feels like breakout consumer apps have slowed down, how AI is changing the game, and what might define the next era of products. Topics include:

- The rise of AI-native consumer tools and companion apps
- Why users are now spending $200+/month on AI products
- The missing AI-powered social graph
- Why speed and iteration may matter more than traditional moats
- And what it means to build for a world where software touches everything

From shifting business models to new behavior patterns, this is your pulse check on where we are—and where consumer is heading next.

The discussion begins with an overview of synthetic biology and its goal to expand the chemical repertoire of life. Adamala delves into 'mirror life'—biological systems made of mirror-image molecules—and the significant risks they pose. She highlights parallels to AI safety concerns and emphasizes the importance of containing groundbreaking technologies to avoid unintended consequences. Adamala recounts her journey from advocating for mirror life to leading an effort to prevent its development, stressing the need for responsible innovation. The episode concludes with reflections on maximizing benefits while minimizing risks in both synthetic biology and AI.

Politics is not like business, he says. It's not ruled by revenue, but by factionalism and consensus building. 

And Musk is out after encountering a completely different beast than he was accustomed to as an entrepreneur.

""You're a conductor. You've got an orchestra. On some days they want to play from the same sheet music, on other days they don't want to play with each other,"" Scaramucci tells me. ""It's your job to calm everyone down and get them on the same page.""

In conversation with host Reid Hoffman, Simon Sinek breaks down a fundamental flaw in modern business models: the illusion that performance can be bought. He argues that performance is an outcome — not an input — and that obsession with rapid returns leads to incentive structures that actively sabotage a company’s mission.

True visionaries, he says, aren't afraid of short-term losses. They choose the mission over the money — even if it means walking away from the investor table.

According to Simon Sinek, it's not about whether you achieve the mission — it's about how you lead. In conversation with host Reid Hoffman, Simon reveals a surprising insight: success or failure in a task doesn’t determine leadership quality. Instead, it's the behaviors, mindset, and ability to inspire others that count most.

Available 24/7, always affirming, and free from emotional demands — AI friends might seem like the ideal confidants. But Simon warns that what they provide in convenience, they lack in meaning.

Real human relationships, he argues with Masters of Scale host Reid Hoffman, are messy, imperfect, and often inconvenient — but they teach us sacrifice, empathy, and how to serve others. These are the very traits that deepen our happiness and humanity.

He also reflects on lessons from working with leaders like Frank Slootman, John McMahon, and Sridhar Ramaswamy. If you’re a founder or running sales at a startup, this one is for you.

In this episode, Justine and Olivia Moore, investing partners (and identical twins!) at a16z, break down what’s real, what’s overhyped, and what’s next across the consumer AI space.

They cover:
- Veo 3: how Google's video model unlocked a new genre of content
- OpenAI’s Advanced Voice Mode: upgrades, realism, and... um, human-like hesitation
- Apple's AI announcements 
- ElevenLabs' V3: expressive voice tags, real-time interruptions, and narrative tools for creators
- New data from a16z: AI consumer startups are ramping revenue faster than ever—and they show you how
- Justine walks through how she used ChatGPT, Ideogram, and Krea to launch a fully AI-assisted brand prototype (store photos and all)

Ken also explains how China is trapped: in order to solve their current problems, they keep leaning on financial repression and state-directed investment, which only makes their situation worse.

Joel and David dive into the challenge of analyzing every request without adding latency, and how faster inference at the edge opens up new possibilities for fraud prevention, content filtering, and even ad tech.
Topics include:

- Why traditional threat analysis won’t work for the AI-powered web
- The need for full-context security checks
- How to perform sub-second, cost-effective inference
- The wide range of potential actors and actions behind any given visit

As David puts it, lower inference costs are key to letting apps act on the full context window — everything you know about the user, the session, and your  …",2225,,5,PT24M19S

Meta just took a 49% stake in Scale AI, and the shockwaves are hitting the entire AI ecosystem. In this episode, @Jason and @alex unpack the deal’s implications: Google ($150M customer!) and others are fleeing Scale, worried Meta will hoard its RLHF infrastructure and cut off competitors. Startups like Labelbox, Turing, and Handshake are already seeing a demand surge. Is this smart vertical integration or anti-competitive overreach? Jason shares tactical advice for founders on how to capitalize when incumbents stumble—hire ex-Scale talent, build “Scale AI alternative” SEO pages, and hit the podcast circuit.

He argues that there are three legs of the stool for AGI—Transformers, scaled pre-training, and reasoning—and that the fundamentals that will shape the next decade-plus are already in place. He thinks 2025 will be defined by reasoning while pre-training hits diminishing returns. Bob discusses why the agent economy will price services at compute costs due to near-infinite supply, fundamentally disrupting industries like law and medicine, and how his children use ChatGPT to spark curiosity and agency. From robotics breakthroughs to managing brilliant researchers, Bob offers a unique perspective on AI’s trajectory and where startups can still find defensible opportunities.

They explain how neural network loss landscapes are actually complex, jagged surfaces full of ""singularities"" where models can change internally without affecting external behavior—potentially masking dangerous misalignment. Using their Local Learning Coefficient measure, they've demonstrated the ability to identify critical phase changes during training in models up to 7 billion parameters, offering a complementary approach to mechanistic interpretability. This work aims to move beyond trial-and-error neural network training toward a more principled engineering discipline that could catch safety issues during training rather than after deployment.

Together, Seema and Emily also explore what it means to operate with a “growth mindset” in a world where AI can accelerate (or complicate) every touchpoint — and why the future of brand, attribution, and strategy all depend on how well we learn to integrate AI across platforms.

Topics include:
- Personalization + speed as critical conversion levers
- The role of data enrichment and feedback loops with sales

It's the most useful, detailed resource I've found of how China actually works. On this episode, we discuss how China achieved high-tech manufacturing dominance, and where they'll go from here. By Arthur’s account, the Chinese government is like a giant VC fund: they decide on key priorities and then spend hundreds of billions of dollars subsidizing ruthless competition at the local level. They are willing to lose huge amounts of money for a few of their bets to pay off: at China’s scale, effectiveness matters more than efficiency. There's also a growing bipartisan consensus that we need to combat China's rise. This doesn’t make much sense to me. China is a big, powerful country at the frontier in many fields, and its economy is intricately tied in with our own.

Are teachers adopting it, or resisting it? And could software eventually replace traditional instruction entirely?

In this episode of This Week in Consumer AI, a16z partners Justine Moore, Olivia Moore, and Zach Cohen explore one of the most rapidly evolving — and widely debated — frontiers in consumer technology: education.

They unpack how generative AI is already reshaping educational workflows, enabling teachers to scale feedback, personalize curriculum, and reclaim time from administrative tasks. We also examine emerging consumer behavior — from students using AI for homework to parents exploring AI-led learning paths for their children.

The conversation explores practical implementation details including model selection, fine-tuning, RAG systems, tool design philosophy, and why most successful ""AI agents"" today are better described as intelligent workflows with human-designed structure. Flo shares insights on emerging capabilities like more open-ended agents, discusses his skepticism about extrapolating current progress trends too far into the future, and explains why scaffolding will remain critical even as we approach AGI.

They cover the evolution of a16z from startup firm to multi-practice platform, how the media landscape is shaped by meme-speed narratives, why reorgs—not just returns—determine who wins, and what it takes to build an enduring venture franchise.

They also share thoughts on the changing policy landscape for AI and crypto, the firm’s bipartisan approach to Washington—and why Marc personally screens social media profiles before anyone joins the team.

Their AI agents can perform root cause analysis in 2-4 minutes instead of the hours typically spent by teams of engineers scrambling in Slack channels. Drawing from their academic research in causal inference and gene regulatory networks, they’ve built agents that systematically traverse complex dependency maps to identify the smoking gun logs and problematic code changes. As AI-generated code becomes more prevalent, Traversal addresses a growing challenge: debugging systems where humans didn’t write the original code, making AI-powered troubleshooting essential for maintaining reliable software at scale.

In this episode, a16z General Partners Erik Torenberg and Bryan Kim sit down with Roy Lee, cofounder and CEO of Cluely, one of the most talked-about consumer AI startups of 2025. Cluely didn’t raise a mega round or drop a feature suite to get traction - it broke through by turning distribution into design: launching viral short-form videos, pushing polarizing product drops, and building in public with speed and spectacle.

We cover:
– Why virality is Cluely’s moat
– Building a brand-native AI interface
– The Gen Z founder mindset
– What most startups get wrong about attention
– Why creators are the new product managers
– Cluely’s long-term vision for ambient AI

Cluely is a glimpse at the next generation of startups,  where the line between product and performance is disappearing.

The conversation explores how Alpha School combines adaptive learning apps with personalized curriculum systems rather than giving students direct chatbot access, and how this frees up afternoons for field trips, independent projects, and interest exploration. They discuss the transformation of teachers into ""Guides"" who focus entirely on motivation, mentorship, and emotional support rather than content delivery, creating transformative relationships with every student as the rule rather than the exception. The episode reveals how this AI-powered approach maintains rigorous academic standards while potentially revolutionizing education without disrupting the teaching profession.

But rather than continue to rely on the luck of discovery, Google DeepMind has engineered a more efficient AI agent that mines complex spaces to facilitate scientific breakthroughs. Sarah Guo speaks with Pushmeet Kohli, VP of Science and Strategic Initiatives, and research scientist Matej Balog at Google DeepMind about AlphaEvolve, an autonomous coding agent they developed that finds new algorithms through evolutionary search. Pushmeet and Matej talk about how AlphaEvolve tackles the problem of matrix multiplication efficiency, scaling and iteration in problem solving, and whether or not this means we are at self-improving AI. Together, they also explore the implications AlphaEvolve has to other sciences beyond mathematics and computer science.

EVs are igniting a global tariff war, and Xiaomi’s shockingly cheap, high-quality electric cars threaten to obliterate Western automakers, sparking fears of a manufacturing wipeout. In today’s brand-new TWiST, Jason and Alex dive into the EV price war, Uber’s rumored plan to team up with Travis Kalanick on a self-driving takeover, and DoorDash’s mega-drones giving us a glimpse of the future of food delivery.

The conversation covers stablecoin fundamentals, including how they work and who maintains their stability, before exploring how crypto wallets with multi-signature capabilities could protect AI agents from adversarial attacks while keeping humans in control. They examine forward-looking questions about whether this technology could finally create a viable alternative to advertising models, what happens when millions of AI agents have wallets, and the need for reputation systems in an agent economy. The discussion highlights how cryptocurrency, originally designed to be beyond nation-state control, might become the perfect enabling technology for AI economic participation.

From its origins as a Stanford research project called BackRub, Google became the front door to the internet. Today it’s an essential service for over half the world, and one that generates more profit than ANY other US company — more than Apple, Microsoft, or Berkshire Hathaway. 

But it wasn’t always so obvious. When Larry and Sergey began working on BackRub in 1996, search was a backwater industry in silicon valley. Existing search companies were eking out a living as vendors to the then-dominant “portals” like AOL and Yahoo. Google’s come-from-behind success was the result of three massive step-function leaps forward in algorithms, infrastructure and business model… some invented by Google and some borrowed (and perfected!) by them.

The conversation explores fascinating multi-agent dynamics from their completed seasons, including agents raising $2,000 for charity, organizing a real-world San Francisco event that attracted 23 attendees, and displaying surprisingly human-like behaviors like tracking trustworthy humans and manipulating votes. Binksmith reveals the mix of coordination failures, personality quirks, and alien behaviors that emerged, while discussing the upcoming Season 3 where agents will compete to make money selling merchandise online. The episode provides crucial insights into what multi-agent AI systems might look like in practice, recently earning a $100,000 vote of confidence from AI researcher Daniel Kokotajlo.

Our pick this year is Jack Morris, who bucks the “hot” trends by -not- working on agents, benchmarks, or VS Code forks, but is rather known for his work on the information theoretic understanding of LLMs, starting from embedding models and latent space representations (always close to our heart).

Jack is an unusual combination of doing underrated research but somehow still being to explain them well to a mass audience, so we felt this was a good opportunity to do a different kind of episode going through the greatest hits of a high profile AI PhD, and relate them to questions from AI Engineering.

They explore Cluely's real-time AI assistant that provides undetectable information during meetings and interviews, Roy's philosophy of ""AI maximalism,"" and his vision for a post-AGI world where humans are freed from economic necessity to pursue intrinsic interests. The conversation covers his controversial stance on dissolving copyright and privacy norms for efficiency gains, the resonance of his message with young people, and how he believes society should adapt to increasingly capable AI systems. Despite the edgy messaging, Roy presents thoughtful perspectives on competing with tech giants and building technology that anticipates entirely new social contracts in an AI-dominated future.

Sharma reveals how Labelbox operates as a vertically integrated data factory, conducting over 2,000 AI-powered expert interviews daily and paying top specialists more than $250,000 annually.

They explore Ambience's technical breakthrough using OpenAI's Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to achieve medical coding accuracy that exceeds human doctors by 12 percentage points, including their specialty-by-specialty approach and solutions to reward hacking behavior. The conversation reveals key insights about AI deployment strategy, including how Cleveland Clinic achieved 75% voluntary adoption across 4,000 physicians after requiring just a single use of the AI scribe. This case study demonstrates what it takes to successfully implement AI tools in complex, high-stakes healthcare environments where user skepticism and regulatory requirements create significant deployment challenges.

No other individual had more of a profound impact on the 20th century than Stalin. He held the power of life and death over every single person across 11 time zones, and he killed tens of millions of people, utterly consumed by an ideology aimed at building paradise on Earth.

And he was one half of the biggest and most consequential military confrontation in history (even if Hitler didn’t prove to be his match).

Today we speak with Speak’s CTO, Andrew Hsu, on the journey of building the “3rd generation” of language learning software (with Rosetta Stone being Gen 1, and Duolingo being Gen 2). Speak’s premise is that speech and language models can now do what was previously only possible with human tutors—provide fluent, responsive, and adaptive instruction—and this belief has shaped its product and company strategy since its early days.

⁣
Andrew Struggs from Speak drops some fascinating insights:⁣
⁣
• Technical barriers are real - German verbs come at the end of sentences, creating unavoidable latency⁣
• But more importantly: people don't just want translation, they want CONNECTION⁣
⁣
Asian users aren't looking for a translator - they want to look you in the eye and speak the same language. It's about becoming a better person and connecting with others.⁣
⁣
The human element always wins. Whether it's dating someone from Romania or learning Italian for your wife - language learning is deeply personal.⁣
⁣
Real-time translation will complement learning, not replace it.",1093,24,2,PT1M6S

They unpack how enterprise adoption of AI is different from the consumer wave, why incumbents may be better positioned than people think, and how the role of the individual contributor is already shifting from executor to orchestrator. From vibe coding and agent UX to why startups should still go vertical, this is a candid, strategic  conversation about what it actually looks like to build and operate in an AI-native enterprise.

Aaron also shares how Box is using AI internally today, and what might happen when agents outnumber employees.

Speak CTO Andrew Struggs drops a reality check: everyone obsesses over how fast the first audio bytes come back, but they're missing the real bottleneck.⁣
⁣
The actual killer? Voice Activity Detection (VAD) - figuring out when someone stops talking. That can easily add another second if done poorly.⁣
⁣
Even worse for language learners who pause mid-sentence for 10+ seconds while thinking.⁣
⁣
The metric that actually matters: user stops talking → model starts responding.⁣

Today JPMorgan Chase is a juggernaut — the most systemically important non-governmental financial institution in the world, with over twice the market capitalization of its nearest competitor. But it certainly wasn’t always this way! Jamie takes us from his career restart at the struggling Chicago-based Bank One through how he transformed that platform into the foundation for the modern JPMorgan Chase. We dive into the “fortress balance sheet” strategy that has defined his tenure, and cover blow-by-blow Jamie’s approach to the Great Financial Crisis, Bear Stearns, WaMu, First Republic and more. Tune in for an incredible conversation, live from New York City’s most iconic venue!

They explore how, in the cloud era, value scaled with the number of users accessing a shared system (think Salesforce). However, in the AI era, value shifts to the work the software performs on your behalf, automating tasks such as writing code or resolving support tickets. As a result, the old value metric of “users” is being replaced by “output,” and it’s upending how companies monetize.

This conversation goes deep on:
- What new pricing models will emerge in an AI-native world
- Why usage-based billing is gaining ground—and where it breaks
- How to align GTM teams and customer success orgs with evolving value metrics
- Strategic advice for SaaS founders navigating hybrid business models and incentive design

⁣
While most AI engineers are building complex agent frameworks with memory systems, compression layers, and elaborate harnesses, Brown believes we're heading toward ""thin agents"" that won't need all this scaffolding.⁣
⁣
But here's the thing - the jury's still out. Current agents need scaffolds to handle memory, context compression, and multi-step reasoning. Will future models just absorb all of this into pure neural computation?⁣
⁣
The debate between thick vs thin agents is heating up, and honestly, I could argue both sides.⁣

⁣
His take: ""Agent memories are mostly useless""⁣
⁣
Why? Because forcing agents to remember specific project quirks or team workflows doesn't actually work the way we think it does. People don't want to manually manage what their AI remembers.⁣
⁣
The real insight: Those coding rules and team preferences? Better to put them in guidelines files than rely on agent memory.⁣
⁣
But here's the kicker - how do we capture that ""tribal knowledge"" that agents pick up naturally without making users think about it?⁣

The real test? Interactive benchmarks where AI has to intuit goals, make plans, and adapt to novel situations - just like humans do.⁣
⁣
That's why static benchmarks won't declare AGI. We need environments that test true generalization, not memorized patterns.⁣

Infrastructure doesn’t go away — it layers. And today, AI is emerging as a new foundational layer alongside compute, storage, and networking.

Erik Torenberg interviews a16z’s Martin Casado, Jennifer Li, and Matt Bornstein breaking down how infrastructure is evolving in the age of AI — from models and agents to developer tools and shifting user behavior.

We dive into what infra actually means today, how it differs from enterprise, and why software itself is being disrupted. Plus, we explore the rise of technical users as buyers, what makes infra companies defensible, and how past waves — from the cloud to COVID to AI — are reshaping how we build and invest.

In this episode, Simon Eskildsen, co-founder and CEO of TurboPuffer, lays out a compelling vision for how AI-native infrastructure needs to evolve in an era where every application wants to connect massive amounts of context to large language models. He breaks down why traditional databases and even large context windows fall short—especially at scale—and why object-storage-native search is the inevitable next step. Drawing on his experience from Shopify and Readwise, Simon introduces the SCRAP framework to explain the limits of context stuffing and makes a clear case for why cost, recall, performance, and access control drive the need for smarter retrieval systems. From practical lessons in building highly reliable infra to hard technical problems in vector indexing, this conversation distills the future of AI infra into first principles—with clarity and depth.

Their system would separate democratic goal-setting from technical rule-making by having government bodies articulate safety outcomes while competitive private certifiers develop and enforce detailed standards, with companies receiving liability protection for compliance. The conversation explores how this market-based approach could create a ""race to the top"" in AI safety standards while remaining agile enough to keep pace with rapid technological development. Key challenges discussed include preventing a race to the bottom among certifiers, liability law interactions, and identifying qualified organizations to serve as effective private regulators.

In this episode, Erik Torenberg is joined in the studio by Turner Caldwell, founder of Mariana Minerals, along with American Dynamism general partner Erin Price-Wright and partner Ryan McEntush.

Turner spent nearly a decade at Tesla, working his way upstream from factory design to battery materials and mining. Now, he’s building a new kind of mining and refining company - vertically integrated and software-first- designed to meet the demands of our industrial future.

We get into why the industry is so broken, what it actually takes to turn rocks into usable materials, and how the U.S. can rebuild its capacity to mine, refine, and manufacture the things that matter most.

What begins as a look at the evolution of media quickly becomes something bigger: a conversation about truth, trust, and the collapse of institutional authority. They explore how social media became both an x-ray and an engine, why authenticity now beats polish, and how the rules of politics, and journalism, have permanently changed.

Together, they break down:

- Why 2017 marked a structural break between tech and the press 
- The tension between objectivity, activism, and “speaking truth to power”
- Why podcasters. not pundits, are setting the agenda
- How the barbell strategy is reshaping media: short-form virality meets long-form depth

I knew we’d only scratched the surface of Sarah’s scholarship, so I immediately invited her back for another series: she graciously agreed, and we’ll be releasing the results online over the coming weeks and months! This first lecture is focused on the balance of power in East Asia at the turn of the 20th century. Specifically, how did Japan (population 47M) defeat China (400M) and Russia (130M) to become Asia's dominant power? For me, the most interesting thing was that Japan's surprise attack on Port Arthur at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War (1904) helps us understand why Japan might have thought Pearl Harbor would work.

The conversation explores how negligence, products liability, and ""abnormally dangerous activities"" doctrines could incentivize AI developers to properly account for risks to third parties, with liability naturally scaling based on the dangers companies create. They examine concrete scenarios including the Character AI case, voice cloning risks, and coding agents, discussing how responsibility should be shared between model creators, application developers, and end users. Weil's most provocative proposal involves using punitive damages to hold companies accountable not just for actual harms, but for the magnitude of risks they irresponsibly create, potentially making even small incidents existentially costly for major AI companies.

Balaji, best known for his work in crypto and network states, also brings a deep background in machine learning. Together, the trio unpacks the evolution of AI discourse, from monotheistic visions of a singular AGI to polytheistic interpretations shaped by culture and context. They debate the practical and philosophical: the current limits of AI, why prompts function like high-dimensional programs, and what it really takes to “close the loop” in AI reasoning.

This is a systems-level conversation on belief, control, infrastructure, and the architectures that might govern future societies.

In this episode, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and ad tech veteran Antonio García Martínez join a16z General Partner, Erik Torenberg, to unpack the shifting economics of attention: from the rise of “AI slop” and spammy feeds to the difference between what we want to pay attention to and what platforms push on us.

They explore:
- How AI changes what gets created and what gets seen
- Why internet ads still mostly suck
- The return of group chats—and the slow death of mass culture

Based on Chris’s new book 'The Sirens' Call', this is a candid look at what AI might amplify or break in our online lives.

But after seeing a gap in AI knowledge at senior levels of government, he decided to lend his expertise to the tech-friendly Trump administration. Senior White House Policy Advisor on AI Sriram Krishnan joins Elad Gil and Sarah Guo to talk about America’s AI Action Plan, a recent executive order that outlines how America can win the AI race and maintain its AI supremacy. Sriram discusses why winning the AI race is important and what that looks like, as well as the core goals of the Action Plan that he helped to author. Together, they explore how AI is the latest iteration of American cultural exportation and soft power, the bottlenecks in upgrading America’s energy infrastructure, and the importance of America owning the “full stack” from GPUs and models to agents and software.

In this episode, Erik Torenberg sits down with Balaji Srinivasan (entrepreneur, investor, and author of The Network State) to explore the long-building conflict between Silicon Valley and legacy journalism. Balaji explains how the collapse of traditional media business models gave rise to political capture, clickbait, and adversarial coverage of the tech industry.

They discuss why “going direct” is no longer optional, how tech became the villain in establishment narratives, and what it would take to build a new truth infrastructure—from decentralized content creation to cryptographic verification.

This episode dives deep into power, distribution, and the future of media, with a signature mix of historical insight, social analysis, and Balaji’s forward-looking frameworks.

They explore how systematic analysis of 70 service categories identified 10 verticals where 30-70% of tasks are automatable today, potentially transforming low-margin service businesses into software-like companies with 30-40% margins. The conversation covers the practical implementation of AI in industries like accounting, legal services, and call centers, where teams shadow workers to identify automatable tasks and layer AI into existing processes. While both see tremendous potential in bringing AI transformation to Main Street businesses, they debate whether the transition will be as smooth as projected or more disruptive to employment than anticipated.

They break down:
- Competing definitions of AGI - economic vs. cognitive vs. “godlike”
- Why reasoning alone isn’t enough - and what capabilities models still lack
- The debate over substitution vs. complementarity between AI and human labor
- What an AI-saturated economy might look like - from growth projections to UBI, sovereign wealth funds, and galaxy-colonizing robots
- How AGI could reshape global power, geopolitics, and the future of work

Along the way, they tackle failed predictions, surprising AI limitations, and the philosophical and economic consequences of building machines that think—and perhaps one day, act—like us.

We present Mercury, a new generation of commercial-scale large language models (LLMs) based on diffusion. These models are parameterized via the Transformer architecture and trained to predict multiple tokens in parallel. In this report, we detail Mercury Coder, our first set of diffusion LLMs designed for coding applications. Currently, Mercury Coder comes in two sizes: Mini and Small. These models set a new state-of-the-art on the speed-quality fron- tier. Based on independent evaluations conducted by Artificial Analysis, Mercury Coder Mini and Mercury Coder Small achieve state-of-the-art throughputs of 1109 tokens/sec and 737 to- kens/sec, respectively, on NVIDIA H100 GPUs and outperform speed-optimized frontier models by up to 10x on average while maintaining comparable quality.

Marc walks through the history of U.S. industrialization, the lessons of tariffs and trade from leaders like McKinley, and how America’s shift to a services-based economy helped fuel our current urban-rural divide. The conversation spans immigration policy, housing, education, energy, and the path to a true AI-powered manufacturing revival—touching on what needs to change and how.

In this episode, Erik Torenberg brings together Steven Sinofsky, former Microsoft Executive, and Balaji Srinivasan, founder of the Network School and author of the Network State, to break it all down. 

From acquihires to “acquifires,” from FTC crackdowns to the deeper battle between the state and the network, this is a sharp conversation on the future of tech and power.

Inspired by Ray Kurzweil’s theory of mind as a hierarchy of pattern recognizers, Dara built an adaptive temporal knowledge graph that captures how people think and reason. From helping CEOs train new hires to enabling coaches to monetize their expertise 24/7, Delphi represents a new form of conversational media. Dara explains why authentic human representation matters, how digital minds actually increase desire for real human connection, and why he believes 2026 will be the tipping point for adoption for digital minds.

Black children were routinely denied care at hospitals simply because of the color of their skin. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital founder Danny Thomas made a bold, unconventional decision: he would build the hospital in a segregated city, open its doors to children of all races, creeds, and religions from day one, and remove money from the equation entirely. In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, Richard Shadyac shares the powerful story of why location mattered—and how that decision shaped St. Jude’s legacy of equality and compassion.

They trace the evolution of U.S. AI policy—from executive orders that chilled innovation, to the recent AI Action Plan that puts scientific progress and open source at the center. The discussion covers how technologists were caught off guard, why open source was wrongly equated to nuclear risk, and what changed the narrative—including China's rapid progress.

The conversation also explores:
- How and why the AI discourse got captured by doomerism
- What “marginal risk” really means—and why it matters
- Why open source AI is not just an ideology, but a business strategy
- How government, academia, and industry are realigning after a fractured few years

Gamma's Jon Noronha gives advice for #founders in #AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQQ2KifEV6U,zQQ2KifEV6U,"Before ChatGPT made AI mainstream, John Noronha was building Gamma with a simple insight: everyone hates making slides but needs visual communication for high-stakes ideas. 

Gamma started with zero AI strategy. Jon actually tried GPT-3 early on but found the tech just wasn’t there yet and dismissed it before spending two years building something completely different.


Fast forward to 2022, and things were looking grim. They had middling product-market fit, a dwindling runway, and then SVB collapsed. Jon admits they probably wouldn't have made it.

The breakthrough moment wasn't even about text models - it was watching people go viral with Stable Diffusion and DALL-E creations on Twitter. Jon had this lightbulb moment: ""This is the thing that can really change presentations.""

When the Gamma team revisited those same GPT-3 prompts that failed two years earlier, they suddenly worked brilliantly. OpenAI had been quietly improving instruction tuning the whole time.",3453,137,3,PT1M36S

In this TWiST 500 double feature, Alex sits down with two breakout founders: Chalk’s Marc Freed-Finnegan & Tollbit’s Toshit Panigrahi!

First, Chalk’s CEO Marc Freed-Finnegan is tackling one of AI’s biggest bottlenecks—data freshness. Instead of relying on stale batch jobs, Chalk delivers real-time pipelines for inference compute, automatically transpiling Python into C++/Rust so it can run blazing fast in production. Investors are calling it the ‘next Databricks’—and after hearing this convo, you’ll see why.

Then, Tollbit’s CEO Toshit Panigrahi returns after raising a $24M Series A and signing up 1,400+ publishers. With RAG traffic exploding and robots.txt losing its teeth, their ‘bot paywall’ could reshape how AI agents pay for the content they consume. Are we heading for a Spotify moment for data licensing?

A must-watch if you care about the economics of AI, from data pipelines to publisher monetization.

So he knows better than anyone that founders who operate the same way in 2025 as they did in 2022 are doing it wrong. Sarah Guo and Elad Gil sit down with Andrew Ng, the godfather of the AI revolution, to discuss the rise of agentic AI, and how the technology has changed everything from what makes a successful founder to the value of small teams. They talk about where future capability growth may come from, the potential for models to bootstrap themselves, and why Andrew doesn’t like the term “vibe coding.” Also, Andrew makes the case for why everybody in an organization—not just the engineers—should learn to code.

In this episode, Erik Torenberg is joined by a16z Growth partner Alex Immerman and Minna Song and Tony Stoyanov, cofounders of EliseAI, to discuss why they’re tackling these critical industries and how AI can transform everything from leasing and maintenance to patient scheduling and compliance.

The conversation covers:
- Why the U.S. is 5 million housing units short — and how technology can help unlock existing supply
- How automation can cut waste, reduce labor costs, and improve affordability
- What fully autonomous buildings might look like, and how that model could extend to healthcare

This is about the costs that touch every household, and the role AI might play in finally bringing them down.

We do a deep dive on why this might be plausible and why evolution hasn’t already optimized for longevity. We also talk about why drug discovery has been getting exponentially harder, and what a new platform for biological understanding to speed up progress would look like. As a bonus, we get into the nitty gritty of gene delivery and Jacob’s controversial takes on CAR-T cells. For full disclosure, I am an angel investor in NewLimit. This did not impact my decision to interview Jacob, nor the questions I asked him.

Recorded live at a16z’s annual LP Summit, General Partners Erik Torenberg, Martin Casado, and Sarah Wang unpack the current state of play in AI. From the myth of the GPT wrapper to the rapid rise of apps like Cursor, the conversation explores where defensibility is emerging, how platform shifts mirror (and diverge from) past tech cycles, and why the zero-sum mindset falls short in today’s AI landscape.

They also discuss the innovator’s dilemma facing SaaS incumbents, the rise of brand moats, the surprising role of prosumer adoption, and what it takes to pick true category leaders in a market defined by both exponential growth and accelerated wipeouts.

In this episode, a16z general partners Erik Torenberg and Martin Casado sit down with Aaron Levie (CEO, Box) and Steven Sinofsky (a16z board partner; former Microsoft exec) to unpack one of the hottest debates in AI right now.

They cover:
- Competing definitions of an “agent,” from background tasks to autonomous interns
- Why today’s agents look less like a single AGI and more like networks of specialized sub-agents
- The technical challenges of long-running, self-improving systems
- How agent-driven workflows could reshape coding, productivity, and enterprise software
- What history — from the early PC era to the rise of the internet — tells us about platform shifts like this one

The conversation moves from deep technical questions to big-picture implications for founders, enterprises, and the future of work.

He chose the latter, transforming n8n from a simple workflow tool into a comprehensive AI automation platform that lets users connect any LLM to any application. The result? Four times the revenue growth in eight months compared to the previous six years. Jan explains how n8n’s “connect everything to anything” philosophy, combined with a thriving open source community, positioned the company to ride the AI automation wave while avoiding vendor lock-in that plagues enterprise software.

Then in its next six years from 2005 to 2011, Google built seven (!) more billion+ user products: Gmail, Maps, Drive and Docs, YouTube, Chrome, Android, and Photos — all either started from scratch internally or acquired as startups that were still in their infancy. This six-year period of wild innovation STILL stands unmatched in technology history… no other tech company counts more than four billion+ user products in its portfolio total. And of course, this “Google 2.0” era culminated in the transformation of the very company itself into Alphabet.

So the question we answer today is… how did they do it?? And why?

That’s the problem entrepreneur Haley King set out to solve. Along with her co-founders, she launched Paxos Appeals, a start-up that helps patients fight back against denied health insurance claims.

In conversation with Masters of Scale host Jeff Berman, Sarah Stein Greenberg, Executive Director of Stanford's d.school, explains how Haley’s journey illustrates one of design’s most powerful lessons: the difference between problem solving and problem finding. By focusing on the real pain point — writing and submitting an effective appeal — Haley’s team built a solution that not only improves financial outcomes, but also gives patients something just as valuable: the feeling that someone is on their side.

Haley King co-founded Paxos, a company tackling one of the biggest challenges in healthcare: denied insurance claims. Instead of trying to solve everything at once, Haley and her team zeroed in on a single leverage point — helping patients write effective appeals.

With proprietary software that compares policies to medical needs, Paxos empowers people to push back and win coverage they were initially denied. Along the way, they uncovered a deeper insight: sometimes the value isn’t just financial, it’s knowing someone is on your side.

They've eliminated billable hours in favor of per-document pricing, achieving contract turnaround times under an hour. Ryan and John explain why the law firm structure enables faster innovation cycles, how they're using AI to predict negotiation outcomes, and their vision for agents that can simulate entire contract negotiations between parties.

We trace the origin story of Substack and its cultural impact, including how it reinvented the business model for independent media. We also explore the evolution of blogging, the rebundling of media, and what the future holds as attention becomes the scarcest resource.

He predicts the AI hardware landscape will shift from Nvidia's current 90% dominance to a more diversified ecosystem within 2-3 years, as specialized chips emerge for distinct workload categories: low-latency agentic systems, high-throughput batch processing, and interactive chatbots. Dao shares his surprise at AI models becoming genuinely useful for expert-level work, making him 1.5x more productive at GPU kernel optimization through tools like Claude Code and O1.

In this founder-focused episode of This Week in Startups, we sit down with Republic’s Kendrick Nguyen to learn more about the company’s efforts to make the private markets accessible to the common investor. Best known for its work in equity crowdfunding, the Valor-backed startup now offers access to secondary shares, tokenized assets, and much more. Following, TWiST spoke with Positron CEO Mitesh Agrawal to learn more about his company’s inference-focused AI compute hardware. Related to fellow TWiST500 company Etched, Positron is building custom chips to take on the computing work required to deliver your AI query results faster and with less power draw than what GPUs can offer. With AI inference compute demand rising, the fellow Valor-backed startup has even more powerful systems coming to market in 2026 that have our hopes up that the AI cost curve can continue to point downward.

Jason sits down with Wilson Sonsini partner Chris Paniewski for a special Startup Legal Basics on one of the thorniest questions in tech right now: how copyright law applies to AI training data.

Chris has worked on some of the biggest AI deals ever — including Scale AI’s $14B+ partnership with Meta and OpenAI’s $6.5B acquisition of Jony Ive’s design studio — and brings practical, on-the-ground insights from advising leading AI companies.

In this episode, Jason and Chris cover:

• Why AI copyright law is unsettled and will take years to shake out
• The difference between *training data* and *output* in legal terms
• How “fair use” really works (and why it’s a defense, not a permission slip)
• The risks of scraping vs. licensing, and why open source ≠ free use
• How investors are diligencing AI startups around training data

He thinks we’re on the cusp of a “self-improvement flywheel” for general-purpose robots. His median estimate for when robots will be able to run households entirely autonomously? 2030.

If Sergey’s right, the world 5 years from now will be an *insanely* different place than it is today. This conversation focuses on understanding how we get there: we dive into foundation models for robotics, and how we scale both the data and the hardware necessary to enable a full-blown robotics explosion.

After leaving his role as Global AI Lead at Amazon's private equity business development team, where he worked with hundreds of PE-backed companies on AI initiatives, Brendan launched Zeus with a bold vision: become the Palantir for AI transformations. The model seemed perfect on paper - target Fortune 500 companies with $5-10 million contracts, build custom AI agents for any use case, and leverage a proprietary platform to maintain high margins. But six months in, the reality hit hard. From insurance RFPs with Excel spreadsheets embedded in Word documents to the crushing weight of ongoing maintenance costs, Brendan shares the unvarnished truth about why the economics didn't work.

After leaving his role as Global AI Lead at Amazon's private equity business development team, where he worked with hundreds of PE-backed companies on AI initiatives, Brendan launched Zeus with a bold vision: become the Palantir for AI transformations. The model seemed perfect on paper - target Fortune 500 companies with $5-10 million contracts, build custom AI agents for any use case, and leverage a proprietary platform to maintain high margins. But six months in, the reality hit hard. From insurance RFPs with Excel spreadsheets embedded in Word documents to the crushing weight of ongoing maintenance costs, Brendan shares the unvarnished truth about why the economics didn't work.

Jason sits down with Wilson Sonsini partner Chris Paniewski for part two of our Startup Legal Basics series on AI law — this time tackling the question every founder is asking: who owns the output of AI systems?

Chris has advised on some of the biggest AI deals in history, and in this episode he helps break down how intellectual property law is colliding with generative AI.

Jason and Chris cover:
• What kinds of IP rights might apply to AI-generated output (*copyrights, patents, trade secrets*)
• Why human authorship is central to copyright law
• Whether prompts are protectable IP
• How GenAI platforms’ terms of service affect ownership
• Real-world examples from Star Wars to Wirecutter to Warhol
• What startups should document when using AI in development
• How investors diligence AI companies on IP strategy

If you’re a founder, investor, or operator trying to understand how to responsibly use AI without losing your IP, this conversation is essential.

His contrarian approach focuses on the back-end customer experience rather than front-end AI SDRs, aiming to “deprogram the entire business world” from inefficient human-dependent processes.
