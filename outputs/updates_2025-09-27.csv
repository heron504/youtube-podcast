And he thinks LLMs are a dead end. After interviewing him, my steel man of Richard’s position is this: LLMs aren’t capable of learning on-the-job, so no matter how much we scale, we’ll need *some* new architecture to enable continual learning. And once we have it, we won’t need a special training phase — the agent will just learn on-the-fly, like all humans, and indeed, like all animals. This new paradigm will render our current approach with LLMs obsolete.

In our interview, I did my best to represent the view that LLMs might function as the foundation on which experiential learning can happen… Some sparks flew. A big thanks to the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute for inviting me up to Edmonton and for letting me use their studio and equipment. Enjoy!

Factory, a Sequoia-backed producer of AI agents for programming, raised $50 million at a $300 million valuation. So Jason and Alex are wondering… how much capital is TOO MUCH?

We’re going deep on a question that often perplexes founders: How would weigh a HUGE potential market against STIFF pre-existing competition.

PLUS that Neon app that records your calls deleted itself, why AI ISN’T taking away all the radiology jobs yet, how inherent biases impact everyone’s view of the economy, ChatGPT may be getting ads very soon, and MUCH MUCH MORE.
